            <synopsis>
                <synopsis langue="en">Air Buster is a fast side-scrolling shooter. The player controls a small craft through different levels with many enemies. Every level ends with a boss and some sections speed up the gameplay, offering fast obstacle courses both horizontally and vertically scrolling. Flying orange pods release many power-ups at once, enhancing the ships with new or more powerful lasers, wing men and shields. The player can also hold the fire key to charge a blast that removes all enemy bullets from the screen and deals damage to all enemies. With an unforgiving difficulty, every hit is fatal, but the game can be continued from any point as long as there are lives and credits left. The game can be played with two players cooperatively.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">The little and bald prehistoric fellow is back and eager to fight once more, but this time no head-kicking nor bare-teeth hill climbing. PC Denjin is a crazy shooter stuffed with wacky and insane action. Our hero character is somehow very different too - this time he is a flying sunglass-wearing cyborg who fights his way through five intense levels. He is also not alone to face the challenges ahead and the army of minions the evil King Droll sends agains him - he is accompanied by new friends, from a massive robot-rocket to a flying mummy and a big and round floating cow. Smilies and power-ups can of course be collected throughout the game and a special and large sunglass-wearing smiley can call one of PC Denjin's friend to the rescue. But this is not all, if he collects the same kind of smiley twice, then they'll both do a mind-blowing mega-fusion. Freaky stuff. On top of being able to use a large selection of weapons, the player can also charge them up at any time by holding the fire button. Wait too long, and PC Denjin over-heats and drops a huge sunglass-wearing purple poo-poo that explodes and causes a fair amount of damage to all nearby enemies.</synopsis>

The main table has numerous moving targets and ball locks and is two screens high.  There are at least three bonus games that are accessible from the top screen.  Bonus games consist of knocking out moving targets on a separate single-screen bonus table.  </synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">Psygnosis' Ballistix is an arcade game in which you have to manipulate a ball in order to score a goal with your opponent. To do this, you will control an arrow that defines a direction, and pressing the fire key will launch a ball from this arrow in the direction the arrow points to; by launching balls at correct angles, you will manipulate the main ball and control the way it moves. Ballistix also keeps certain physics laws (namely gravity and friction), and will present you with varying obstacles in either one or two player mode.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">Battle Royale is a wrestling game that presents last-man-standing type battles between up two five wrestlers.

The game features three difficulty settings, five wrestlers to choose from, and two game modes. For single players only is the tournament mode, featuring 15 possible consecutive battles, beginning with one-on-ones and continuing up to a full five-man match. In the second mode, the number of competitors can be freely set for a single match. There is a catch in how a player chooses their wrestler, though: before the match, the fighters' managers duke it out on their way to select their favorite fighter - temporarily knocking out the opposition is encouraged.</synopsis>

The power-up system in Blazing Lazers deserves special mention.  There are four main types of weapons, and each type of weapon can be upgraded several times to produce an incredible amount of firepower.  In addition, there are secondary weapons systems that provide you with shields, homing missiles, multi-fire units, or super weapon power.</synopsis>

Based off the 1988 arcade game, this single-player, top-down, run and gun shooter takes a nod to Contra-style gameplay, allowing one of the two mercenaries to blast their way through eight levels of enemy opposition armed with only a knife and a machine gun.  

Along the way, new weapons such as shotguns, bazookas, flash bombs and grenades grenades can be added to the arsenal, as well as health and defensive power-ups.  Players can even find a motorcycle to ride in some areas, or swim through certain parts of a level.

The President and your fellow soldiers need you!</synopsis>

The range of explosion can be upgraded with time, but if you die, the range resets to minimum and you loose your previous skills, though. Some updates can make you walk through the walls, increase your speed, and give you some other assets to aid you in your quest to save the woman you love.

This top-down action-arcade game consists of nine levels per stage, each tougher than the other, and each final consisting of the boss you'll have to deal with. You can move horizontally and vertically and lay down bombs behind you thus evaporating the enemies, but beware, 'cos you can block yourself with your own bomb, and become a victim of your own tricks if you'll play in a huff.</synopsis>

The objective is the same as in Dyna Blaster: use bombs to destroy all enemies in a level. Once you have destroyed them all, find the exit hidden in a block so you can be transported to the next level. A block will also flash yellow to let you know that a power-up can be obtained there. Power-ups include more bombs, manual detonation, extra lives, and extended flames. Occasionally, you also get the ability to walk through bombs or walls, or to kick bombs.

If you manage to reveal the exit before all enemies are destroyed, it remains in an "inactive" state, meaning that you cannot be transported to the next level until you blow up all the enemies and therefore making it "active". If you accidentally blow up the exit, whether it is active or not, or if time runs out, you will unleash a few enemies that you also need to destroy. After every eighth level, there is a boss that you need to destroy to proceed to the next planet.

Besides this Normal mode, there are two other modes: Battle and Versus. In Battle, you can play against four human- or computer-controlled players in one of seven stages, each with different features like warp holes, conveyor belts, revolving doors, and much more. In Versus, you play head-to-head against a friend using the TurboExpress for non-stop action. Regardless of these two modes, you can still obtain power-ups to give out some punishment against your fellow players, and the maximum number of wins can be set before play.</synopsis>

            <synopsis>
                <synopsis langue="en">Bonk's Adventure is a prehistoric platform game where you are in control of a large bald headed caveman, guiding him through the levels taking out all manner of strange prehistoric creatures that get in your way including King Drools henchmen - all in effort to free the captured/controlled residents of Moonland (bosses) - including the Princess Za from King Drool attempted take over.

The game is not unlike other platform games of the era. Though it's unique in that you can climb walls and swing on rope with your teeth and your only method of attack is head butting enemies - straight forward or dive bomb style. The game starts off with simplistic point A to point B style, but focuses more on exploration in the later stages, which include finding hidden bonus areas. 

The game is also known for its trademark gameplay mechanism of 'spin attack', where Bonk floats through the air if you have the turbo button on. This can be used to float around the level and reach areas for extra/hidden items, but also as a method of attack as well. The game starts you off with 3 hearts, but allows you to increase this number when you find special heart container items, allowing Bonk to take a number of hits before dying.

A variety of bonus stages can be found throughout the game, which provide bonus points upon completion and thus resulting in accumulating extra lives. Enemies themselves can be 'milked' for points in that you can keep 'bonking' their dead bodies and not letting them hit the ground. Spin attack is another method for doing this.</synopsis>

The gameplay in this adventure is very similar to the first game.  Bonk has  head-butting, head-stomping, and fire-breathing moves when he eats some spicy meat.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">Trouble is in the kingdom of Dilsarl: the young, beautiful princess Salasa was abducted by the evil arch-mage Balrog. The king seeks help from the four best warriors of the country. The task is clear, but not so simple: find Balrog, destroy his evil minions and other monsters roaming the land, and rescue the princess.

Cadash is a platform action role-playing game. The player chooses one of the four character classes in the beginning of the game: fighter, priestess, mage, or ninja (the Genesis version has only two characters: fighter and mage). The protagonist fights his or her way through dungeons, attacking physically or casting spells (as priestess or mage). Like in regular platform games, there are places where the player character is required to jump, duck, or climb. The protagonist gains experience for defeating monsters, and their level rises in a true RPG fashion.</synopsis>

Gameplay is something of a Pengo variant, as the single-screen levels are inhabited by enemies, who can be killed by firing one of the balls at them at speed. When it hits one it will continue moving in the same direction, rebounding off walls if neccessary, and pushing you backwards slightly if it comes back to you - but it can be instantaneously brought back under control. Blocks can also be moved at a more casual speed, including round corners. Once a block is placed onto its spot, it can be used again as a weapon. The levels are in a maze style, and parts of this can be opened up. The game also includes a small bonus Kick-Ball game for 2 players, which doubles as practice with the control system.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">Cratermaze is an action puzzle game viewed from an overhead perspective. Each stage consists of a maze filled with various enemies and items. You must collect all of the keys on the stage to open the exit door while avoiding or eliminating enemies. Your primary method of dealing with enemies is to dig holes; if an enemy walks into a hole, they are momentarily trapped and you can then fill the hole to kill the enemy.

You can also obtain temporary weapon powerups such as rayguns and yo-yos, as well as extend your digging reach to dig multiple holes at once. There are also several bosses encountered throughout the game.

The Japanese release, Doraemon: Meikyu Daisakusen, features popular children's character Doraemon and his friends. The game is a conversion of the 1987 Nichibutsu coin-op Kid no Hore Hore Daisakusen, which also saw a modified Famicom version called Booby Kids.</synopsis>

            <synopsis>
                <synopsis langue="en">Darkwing Duck was a popular animated television show that aired on weekday afternoons in the early 1990's. Darkwing was a crime-fighting duck that kept the city safe from a bunch of not-so-smart criminals.

The TurboGrafx-16 game based on the cartoon is very different from the NES and Game Boy Darkwing games. Although it is a side-scrolling platformer, the gameplay and level structure are very different. This game has 4 side-scrolling areas, 1 of which is the final boss level. The other 3 levels can be tackled in any order, and in them you must collect several puzzle pieces.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">About 200 years in the future, a comet is detected at the edge of the solar system.  Astronomers determine that it will pass near the earth, and send probes to examine it.  When the probes near the comet, it abruptly changes directions and heads towards earth.  At the last moment, the people of earth are able to launch surface-to-comet missiles and deflect its impact into the moon. At the center of the impact crater, alien war machines are gathering! The U.N. sends a lone spaceship to the moon to destroy the alien threat.

Dead Moon is a side scrolling shooter with 6 levels that take place on earth, in space, and on the moon.  It features 4 different primary weapon types, and several secondary weapon types.  Each level features mini-bosses and end of level bosses.</synopsis>

Fish Attack Sub is on its way to blast through four scenes of swimming terror and stop the aliens from taking over the sea. Fortunately, the A.N.G.E.L. is helped on its way by a number of power-ups - for instance, Healing Power completely repairs the sub and Speed Power speeds it up. Up to three modes of attack can be used to combat the mutant fish - the starting Pulse Shot, the destructive Swirl Cutter, and the Bubble Beam. But the A.N.G.E.L. is not indestructible. Four colors on the A.N.G.E.L.'s eye indicate the amount of damage the sub has sustained, and when it's had enough and explodes, that's the end of the A.N.G.E.L. and the end of the game.</synopsis>

            <synopsis>
                <synopsis langue="en">Double Dungeons is a solo dungeon crawler in the strictest sense. One or two players can explore pseudo-3D, maze-like dungeons (without auto-map feature, but with directions displayed on the screen) and fight the monsters populating them. The player(s) can choose to venture into any of the available 20 dungeons. The dungeons have the same textures, but their layout varies; the higher is the number of the chosen dungeon, the more dangerous are its enemies. Two-player mode features a split screen; the two players start exploring the dungeon from different points.

The basic gameplay is very simple. Enemies appear at specific points (they can also re-spawn), and must be defeated in order to proceed. The combat is turn-based at its core, though the turns follow very quickly, and the enemies will attack even if the player does nothing. Attacking is done simply by pressing a button; there are no other combat options. 

The player can find equipment and healing items (which can also be dropped by enemies). These can be used to restore the player character's HP outside of battles. Leveling up is completely automatic.

There is no narrative in the game; the only story-related information comes in form of very short text intros to the different dungeons, along the lines of "the king wants to retrieve a treasure and sends a warrior into the dungeon" or comparable mission objectives.</synopsis>

The game differs from Breakout, however, in that the paddle can also be moved up and down, the jewels are moving down toward the player's paddle, and there is a border at the bottom of the play field which bounces the ball back.

The plot of the game involves the antagonist character's girlfriend being in a coma. A muse appears and tells the player that his girlfriend is trapped in a nightmare and is possessed by someone. The muse then casts a spell to put the player into her dreams.</synopsis>

            <synopsis>
                <synopsis langue="en">The former king of Oddesia has entrusted you with an important, dangerous task. You must find the sacred ORA stone, which possesses the powers of life, light and happiness, and retrieve it before the king of the alien race, Natas, does. He has conquered this land and plunged it into an age of terror and despair, plagued with violence. It is up to you to stand against him and return your world to its former glory.

Dungeon Explorer plays like Gauntlet: you choose one of several different characters to play as (Fighter, Thief, Warlock,  Witch, Bard, Bishop, Elf and Knome) and set out on your adventure alone or with up to four other players. Battles are real-time and of the shooter variety, ie, rather than swing a sword, you fire knives (or spells depending on your class). Enemies respawn out of holes in the ground which must be eradicated to keep them from pouring forth in waves. There are a number of items to be found and used throughout the game including potions of white and black magic, healing drinks and the like, but unlike Gauntlet there is no food to worry about.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">When you climb into the cockpit of the F-16 Fighting Falcon, get set for the "fight of your life" as the powerful Falcon F-16 takes you streaking across the sky at mach 2. Accurate weapons system, head-up-displays, cockpit controls and overall flight characteristics make this the ultimate in simulations. The enemy MiGs you encounter are very resourceful and skilled. And if that isn't enough, challenge another pilot in the head-to-head option via direct computer link. State of the art 3D graphic images of buildings, forests, freeways, and bridges flash by as you fly at the speed of sound only 150 feet above the deck. Take out bridges, power stations, tanks, airfields and SAM sites. Whether you are a novice pilot or a real "top gun", FALCON is for you!</synopsis>

The evil Menons are trying to take over all of the planets in the Fantasy Zone by using misappropriated foreign currency to build their forces.

Fantasy Zone is an arcade style shooter for one or two players. The goal is to destroy all of the creatures on each planet and collect as many of the lost coins as possible. At the end of each level is a large enemy that will have to be defeated before moving on to the next world.  At various points in the game, the player will be able to find a parts shop, which allows purchasing improvements for his spaceship, including better weapons and faster engines.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">Final Lap Twin is an open-wheel F1-style racing game loosely based on Namco's Final Lap arcade game.  The game display is always in split screen mode, even if only one player is playing.  The other display shows your nearest rival if you are racing against the computer.

There are two basic modes: Grand Prix and Quest.  Grand Prix consists of a multi-race points championship.  There are two car types for this mode: F-3000 and F1.  Grand Prix mode can be played with one or two players.

Quest mode has more depth and forms the core of Final Lap Twin.  This is essentially a racing RPG.  You take the role of a boy who desires to become the World Champion.  To do so, you must travel from town to town finding challenges and winning them to gain money and special items to improve your car.  As you move around the game world, which is presented in an overhead view, you will encounter random challenges, much like random battles in a traditional RPG.</synopsis>

            <synopsis>
                <synopsis langue="en">Galaga '88 takes the basic gameplay of Galaga and adds higher-quality graphics, triple ship abilities, parsec progression, power-ups, asteroids, bosses and other enhancements. Periodically the player encounters Challenging Stages, which are set to music and feature "dancing" enemies.  The objective is to shoot all 40 enemies before they disappear, for a bonus of at least 10,000 points. There are a total of 29 stages. The player can begin with one ship with two in reserve or start right out with a dual ship (but only one in reserve).  

Some enemies now have the ability to combine into a much larger single enemy that takes multiple shots to destroy. Others explode in a brilliant shower of fireworks when destroyed, and occasionally these enemies drop a small formation of much smaller enemies that "wiggle" their way down the screen.  Some enemies arrive in spherical "eggs" and emit a loud, high-pitched noise when hit. These creatures take multiple hits to destroy in flight (just one hit in formation), and their main attack pattern is to move about halfway down the screen, stop, fire multiple shots at once, and then fly straight down off the bottom of the screen.  Another type of enemy takes at least five hits to destroy, and it grows larger with each consecutive hit, making it both a larger target and allowing it to act as a shield to other enemies. 

Later in the game some enemies are equipped with armor that renders them invincible while in formation. When one of these enemies starts its dive, it will flip over and expose its vulnerable side, then flip over again and become invincible while it moves back up the screen, then flip one more time and finish its dive. While vulnerable, this enemy can be destroyed in one hit, scoring bonus points. In addition, many different kinds of obstacles appear throughout the game, including blue crystals, boulders and green blobs.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">Gunboat is a 2D action simulation. You take control of a U.S. Gunboat in several conflict zones.

Your Gunboat carries a crew of four men:

- A first-class petty officer who serves as boat captain and pilot
- A gunner’s mate, who controls the forward guns
- An engine man, who takes care of the engines and serves as midship gunner
- A seaman who controls the aft guns

All four men are cross-trained in each other’s tasks … redundancy becomes crucial if one or two crew members are wounded or dead.

Be careful on the rivers ...!

                <synopsis langue="en">Monty Mole has been living in luxury since his previous adventures, but he has now been beamed up by an alien race who want him to do a job for them. Monty must trek through five worlds to retrieve the sacred scrolls of the race's Guardians. 

As with Core's previous hit Rick Dangerous 2 there is versatility in the exact structure of the game. The first four consist of the Orient, a Klondike mine, an Ice world and an Amazon forest - once these are completed the final world is open to you.

The platform-based gameplay is similar to Monty's earlier games, with primarily horizontal progresses as well as ropes and ladders to navigate. Monty has developed a useful flying kick, and has been given a smart bomb, with the potential to collect extra bombs and guns. Hazards, enemies and level designs are themed around each level, and range from cable cars and falling snowballs to Ninjas and Monkeys.</synopsis>

Your partner doesn't like this one bit, so he decides to make a nuisance of himself along the way. Similar to Adventure Island, you must make your way through several levels, destroying wildlife along the way, but instead of using a hammer, you have three different ways to kill them: jump on or kick them, or when they are walking on the ground, blow gas out of them. 

While scrolling through the level, your vitality will decrease, but it can be restored by collecting fruit and junk food. During your travels, you will also encounter your partner doing things that shouldn't be done in public, but sometimes, he will throw stuff at you to make you lose some of your vitality. The only way that you can deal with him is by kicking him where it hurts.

Along the way, you can enter doors. Doing this will give you a hint about the level and your vitality will be increased as well. You can kick certain objects such as lamp posts, trashcans, or thin air to obtain coins, or to make hidden platforms appear. Coins can be used in slot machines that will give you extra vitality, more lives, extra coins, and more. Slot machines only appear when you enter certain doors.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">Jackie Chan and his twin sister Josephine were great kung fu fighters in China and trained under a great master. One day when Jackie and Josephine were out walking, the Master's great enemy, The Sorcerer, appeared. The Sorcerer had come to rule over China and knew the twins would stand in his way, so he cast a spell to make Josephine disappear. Now it's up to Jackie Chan to follow after the Sorcerer and battle his minions in order to rescue his sister and save China.

Jackie Chan's Action Kung Fu is a side-scrolling fighting game. Jackie's controls are one button to jump and another one to attack or be used in combination with a direction for a special attack. On his quest, Jackie must punch and kick his way past frogs, ninjas, birds and other enemies. Jackie can acquire special-moves such as the Tornado attack, the 180 degree spin kick, the 360 degree spin kick and the Sky Attack. Other power-ups include energy refills and bonus points. </synopsis>

Tommy may also jump on their heads to stun them for a moment.

Getting power-ups will make the fireball soon increase to a bouncing fireball, which will deal more damage to enemies. Treasure chests can be busted open, allowing Tommy to collect coins. Tommy's journey will have him explore ruins, cliffs, statues, dungeons, and finally the castle. At the end of each level, there is a boss that must be defeated in order to proceed to the next stage.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">Military Madness is a futuristic turn-based strategy war game.  The year is 2089 and the setting is Earth?s moon, which yields many important resources.  While the governments of Earth bicker over their staked claims on the moon, the evil Axis Empire launches a lunar military campaign and takes over the moon, using its factories to produce advanced weaponry, the most devastating of which is the SAM (Supreme Atomic Missile).  As commander of the Allied forces, it is the player?s responsibility to lead what?s left of the Allied armies in a desperate offensive against the Axis Empire on the lunar surface before they can use the SAM to destroy Earth.

There are 32 maps (2 different campaigns with 16 maps each) to play through.  In each map, the player must strategically defeat the outnumbering Axis forces either by destroying all enemy units or capturing the enemy base camp.  There are many different units that both sides utilize - infantry, tanks, aircraft, artillery, and a few others that have specialized functions.  Gameplay consists of moving units into positions that will gain the best advantage to attack the enemy, capitalizing on many factors, which include battle experience, terrain, support tactics, and - sometimes - pure luck.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">The action in this racing game is viewed from above and features rotational controls. There are 6 racetracks featured including real-world ones such as Laguna Seca. Before each race you can buy a full compliment of upgrades and weapons, with each area (engine, handling, turbo and so on) having several variably-priced options. The unusual thing about the racing system is that the action always follows the leader. If you slip too far behind, your car is blown up and placed back onto the track further on in order to keep up (similarly to Micro Machines). This can only happen a limited number of times before the game is over.</synopsis>

Very similar to  Zelda games, Neutopia allows the player to freely roam the vast land, fighting many different monsters in wilderness areas as well as in dungeons. Dungeons also require some puzzle-solving (pushing stones, blowing walls with bombs, etc.). The game has a slight RPG flavor, allowing the player to power-up by collecting various items, and equip different weapons and armor.</synopsis>

            <synopsis>
                <synopsis langue="en">Some years have passed since the brave hero Jazeta destroyed Dirth, the Emperor of Darkness. Peace has returned to the land of Neutopia. But there are still monsters roaming the countryside, and some of them were spotted near Yurius Shrine. Jazeta went there to find out what exactly had happened. But he didn't return... You are Jazeta's son, and you must first of all find your missing father! Can it be that the shadow of Emperor of Darkness threatens the peaceful land again?..

The sequel to "Neutopia" is similar to the predecessor in every way. Navigating your hero from a top-down view, you explore the vast countryside, fighting monsters in real time combat. The game is not a true RPG, but an action adventure: you don't gain any experience points from combat, only collect money to buy supplies. In dungeons, you must use bombs on walls to reveal secret passages, push stones, and fight many regular enemies and bosses.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">Somewhere on the peaceful Adventure Island, Master Higgins weds Tina, the new "Miss Island". Everyone who was invited to the wedding begins to celebrate when, suddenly, the evil Baron Bronsky appears and snatches Tina away, while his henchmen take the six children away. To reach his castle and rescue Tina, Master Higgins must first rescue the six children, each of whom is hidden on a separate island.

New Adventure Island is a one-player action game that consists of seven areas, with four rounds each. In order to get through the areas, you must use your hatchet to destroy wildlife such as frogs, spiders, birds, snails, insects, and other pests, and watch out for hazards such as rocks, fire, water, and pits. 

As you progress further, your vitality will get low, so fruit must be collected in order to restore it. Along the way, you can smash open eggs that will award you with better weapons that include boomerangs, arrows, and magical fire. Some of the eggs will also reveal a fairy, which will protect you from getting hit. If you are unlucky enough to find an eggplant hidden in one of these eggs, your vitality will drain away very fast, and you need to get fruit every five seconds in order to survive.

When you get to the end of an area, you will have to defeat one of the henchmen and rescue a child from one of the four castles.

An update of the original NES game.</synopsis>

To accomplish this task Moonlight is armed with a katana, shurikens, bombs, and a sickle and chain weapon. Each weapon offers its own advantages and must be used at certain times to overcome specific obstacles or opponents. 

The game's coin-op origins are evident in the fact that that the home versions do not have passwords or saves. To compensate for this, however, adjustable difficulty settings were added.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">The people of Radlebb Keep are worried: Undead and werewolves have been seen in the nearby forests, and rumor has that a vampire has taken residence at Koriszegy Keep. Lord Korrigan hires a group of adventurers to dispel the rumors. They soon find out that not only the rumors are true, but that there are also other evil forces at work in the area.

Order of the Griffon is a role-playing game based on 1st Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules (many well-known monsters, magic items and spells are present) and set in the D&amp;D world of Mystara. It uses gameplay conventions that are somewhat similar to those from Strategic Simulations, Inc's Gold Box titles: When the party is in towns and dungeons, a first-person view is used, while overland travel happens on a large map of the area. Combat with monsters is turn-based and takes place on a special tactical screen.

A party consists of four characters, which cannot be created but must be selected from a list of 21 different predetermined characters.</synopsis>

Now equipped with arms, face, and legs, Pac must guide a fairy back to her home in Fairy Land, but this task will not be easy because Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue will pursue Pac-Man as he travels through Pac-Land. When he finally transports the fairy back to her home, Pac is given some magic shoes, which will help him get to his own home, where he will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss. 

There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.</synopsis>

The object of the game is simply that of golf: To complete the course with the fewest shots and lowest score. 

Game modes:

Stroke Play -- Regular mode where competition is based on the total strokes, lowest number of course, is the winner. 

Match Play --  This mode can be against the computer or another player. Players compete for each hole, or, in Club Match, for each other's clubs.

Competition -- This is the three-player mode.  The game operates in the form of a contest, and is recommended for players of differing abilities.  Driving and pin contests are also included in this mode.</synopsis>

            <synopsis>
                <synopsis langue="en">There is something wrong with your brain. It is being taken over by the Devil Ugar himself! Your only recourse is to fight back against this hostile invasion. Thankfully your mind has created the ultimate weapon: a ship with which you can navigate the five causes (stages) and blast back the Devil's evil minions. It is your only hope, your one last chance to free your mind from this evil influence.

Psychosis is a side-scrolling shooter where each level is meant to represent a different location within your mind. One looks like the sky, another filled with aquatic plants, one with what resemble tetris blocks. It is within these stages that you must blast everything in sight while collecting power ups to upgrade your weapon and shield. You can gain two floating balls that resemble mechanical eyes and can be directed 360 degrees around your ship to either act as a shield or to direct your weapon. Battle your way through each stage and defeat the boss at the end and eventually you'll do battle against the very DEVIL himself.</synopsis>

            <synopsis>
                <synopsis langue="en">R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.

The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).

The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">In the year 2090, Earth is invaded by extra-terrestrials. The World Alliance of Nations has developed a supersonic attack fighter, Raiden, to defend the Earth. A pilot must take control of the experimental fighter to destroy the alien warships that just happen to look like odd variations of typical military tanks and planes with gadgets attached to them. 

Raiden (called Raiden Trad on the Genesis and SNES) is an over-head vertical-scrolling shooter, based on an arcade game of the same title. It features two forms of weapon upgrades and two types of missiles (normal or homing). You start the game with several bombs which you can use to destroy most enemies on the screen to get yourself out of a jam. Each level ends with a large boss or bosses.</synopsis>

            <synopsis>
                <synopsis langue="en">In the year 1192, the darkness of the Minamoto clan has come and is spreading across Japan. The country is being ravaged, and only one man of the lost Heike clan can return from the depths of hell to put a stop to it. His name is Taira no Kagekiyo.

The story of Genpei T?ma Den ostensibly revolves around the historical Genpei War from Japanese history, and involves Taira no Kagekiyo fighting the evil Minamoto no Yoritomo and the Minamoto clan across Japan.

The game features three modes of play: "side mode", a small-scale action platforming section; "big mode", a large-scale fighting section comparable to the Taito coin-op Gladiator; and "flat mode", an overhead-view section. In all three sections the goal is to destroy enemies, collect items, and reach the end before the life bar (represented by burning candles) runs out.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">In the sequel to Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman once again the player takes the role of either cyborg Tasuke or Kyapiko (renamed Arnold and Sonya for their US debut) to face an alien threat to the world.

Both cyborgs have traded their energy blades for ranged attacks, which change the pacing of the game a bit but nevertheless remains an action-oriented side-scrolling platformer in which your objective is to clear the stage of all enemies and bosses, while picking up any power-ups that can aid you in your quest. The game makes a linear progression from stage to stage, losing the world map from the original as well as the upgrade buying between levels (since "Doc" the inventor of both cyborgs and provider of upgrades has been abducted by the aliens), although new shooter stages have been included to spice things up.</synopsis>

They must save the earth from the mercenary invaders of Bozon. You must first reach Bozon?s territories, then wipe out its forces hidden in caverns and lurking in underground seas, before destroying the main invasion ship. Lots of extra weapons can be picked up, often with similar tokens to those in 1943 and some other Capcom titles. Most weapons can be shot either to the left or the right, giving you more range to launch attacks.</synopsis>

Silent Debuggers is an action game with a first-person perspective. The game advances in real-time but movement progresses in fixed steps like in many first-person dungeon games. Enemies are targeted with a crosshair that can be moved around the screen.

Fight monsters with a variety of weapons and protect the valuable utility rooms around the center of the station from being cut-off by monsters as you advance through each level of the station.  Tools provided by Leon give the player special abilities.</synopsis>

There are also several different powerups you can pick up such as missiles and different types of lasers.

The plot in the game is not real clear according to the instruction booklet. Apparently something called a "Sinistron" has invaded your quadrant of the galaxy and you have to blow it up, just because.

This game has large enemy sprites and large boss characters. The levels take place mostly in outer space and alien environments. Some of the sprites are Macross-like mechs.

The Japanese version, "Violent Soldier", had slightly different graphics.</synopsis>

Soldier Blade puts you in direct control of a starfighter as you make your way through each enemy-infested stage. You are not alone in the fight this time however, as a small mecha follows your fighter at all times, and provides cover and supporting firepower at regular intervals.

The game also features a unique weapon system with three customizable gun pods, in which you can mount any of the several types of weapons available. Additionally you can sacrifice each of your pods to incorporate "option" satellites, bombs and other super moves depending on the pod/weapon combination you have equipped.</synopsis>

You move around mazes, climbing on walls, on the ceiling, through shortcuts, and attempt to find you way to the end.  Along the way, you have to shoot out many, many enemies.  And at the end, you will find a nasty boss surprise.

The story is bizarre, which fits the concept of the game.  A sorceress has plans to rule the world.  To do so, she has summoned 12 beasts, each based on a sign of the zodiac.  It up to you, pink slinky, to defeat the 12 astrological signs.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">Sonic Spike is a beach volleyball game. The player takes the role of a volleyball team with two athletes (which have different strengths and disadvantages) and tries to win a tournament. The second athlete can also be played by a second human player. The controls offer no surprises: players move an athlete over the field and use two buttons for jumping and hitting. Single players also have to switch between the two athletes.</synopsis>

Armed with a really big gun, you have to defend yourself against the alien hordes using your wits to navigate around the screen. But watch out for those end of level bosses!

Originating in the arcades, Space Harrier is a third-person rail shooter with pseudo-3D graphics, set in the same world as Fantasy Zone. The lone titular hero fights aliens with a fireball-launching cannon, which can also be used to transform the hero into a flying rocket. The protagonist is constantly in motion, but the speed of his movement can be regulated by the player.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">Splatterhouse is the first game in the series, but only the second game to appear on a home console (after Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti on the NES), which was later continued on the SEGA Genesis.

Rick and his girlfriend Jennifer enter West Mansion (known as Splatterhouse) to study Dr. West's parapsychology teachings for a school project.  After a flash of lightning and a scream, Jennifer is gone, and Rick is left wearing the Terror Mask, which gives the wearer great strength.

Rick must survive seven blood-soaked levels full of corpses, demons, and other disturbing creatures in this arcade side-scrolling beat-em-up. Several weapons are at Rick's disposal throughout the house, such as a meat cleaver, a two by four, and a shotgun. If Rick wants to find Jennifer alive, he must move quickly through the floors of the mansion.... as a happy reunion is not always guaranteed.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">Super Volleyball is an indoor volleyball game for one or two players. The single player mode offers two game options: normal game and World League. Choosing normal game pits the player against the computer in a single game. Choosing World League pits the player against all other teams available. A password save is available in this mode.

The game features eight national teams (USA, USSR, Brazil, Holland, France, Italy, Japan and China), with fictitiously named players. Players can be changed during gameplay by pressing C. There is also an option to create new teams, choosing the team's name, color, player's position and names.

Gameplay is viewed from a side scrolling perspective, with the camera fixed on the ball. A small radar on the top of the screen shows the players' positions of both teams. Players can, bump, set, spike, dump, block and dig. A collection of serves is also available: underhand, overhand and jump serve. There are also options for three ball speeds, beginning points (from 0 to 10, out of 15) and handicap.</synopsis>

The New York City Police Department has established a special task force to help clean up the city. The task force is led by Detective Tony Gibson,a former Formula 1 driver. With his partner Raymond Brody, he patrols the city in his specially armored and supercharged Chase 928S4.

            <synopsis>
                <synopsis langue="en">Takin' it to the Hoop is a basketball game with comic graphics. The player either participates in a league, play-offs or a single match and chooses one of eight American teams with twelve athletes. The team's performance during a match does not only depend on the player's ability but also on the athlethe's statistics (e.g. agility or dribbling) and their energy. Energy decreases during the course of a match and describes how much power an athlete has left. There are also three different defense tactics (one-on-one defense, zone defense or a mix between the two) which can be set before the match or during interceptions.

During the matches, the player controls the ball carrier when in offense and manually switches between athletes when in defense. Passes can be performed in a high or low variation. While most of the match is shown in a slightly heightened side-scrolling perspective, the game switches to a close-up view during a penalty throw or a dunking try. Here the player needs to press a button at the correct timing for a successful throw. When a defense athlete is nearby during a during maneuver, he has the opportunity to block the ball when the correct timing is met.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">The Axe is back... with twice the force and twice the fury of 1989's "Videogame of the Year"! This time it's brother against brother locked in deadly combat. Your older brother has summoned unspeakable forces of evil to take control of the kingdom. Treachery rules! Your only hope is the legendary royal sword! But will its power be enough to overcome the Cliffs of Chaos? The Skull Dungeons? And the treacherous Crypts of Slime? Only your courage, your fighting skill, and the Legendary Axe can answer!

This game has you fighting monsters through seven stages with just a sword, but three other weapons can be picked up along the way, and include axes, chain spears, and smart bombs. These weapons can only be obtained by collecting the power-up that a defeated enemy leaves behind. Weapons can be switched along the way. At the end of each level, you must defeat a huge boss in order to go to the next stage.</synopsis>

Many levels are horizontally scrolling, although with high ledges to jump onto and follow for a slightly different path. Magic urns containing improved weapons appear frequently. Most enemies are easy to attack and only need one hit to kill, although they come at you in large hordes. Once you get to the indoor sections you will find big enemies with the ability to kill you with one hit, in sections set on multiple levels complete with stairways.</synopsis>

That's it. So what this all amounts to is you frantically sliding the tiles around block-puzzle style to keep that cursed ball bearing on track. God forbid that you think the ball is moving too slowly, you can even push a button to speed the damn thing up, but you have to wonder why you would ever want to do that.</synopsis>

You have to kick two of the same item together, and they disappear, until you clear the board of pieces. You can 
bump one item with another unless the way is blocked.

There are also enemies that you have to kick into bumpers to destroy them.

The game has a regular mode and a special mode with 60 puzzles each.  Many of the puzzles are quite difficult even in regular mode.</synopsis>

Only Turrican can save them in this fast paced side scrolling shoot-em up. It features 5 worlds and 13 levels of challenging gameplay.

Gameplay is conceptually simple: just jump, shoot and explore. However, this game puts a lot of emphasis on finding and using the 10 different weapons Turrican can collect.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">Basketball was the second sport to which Cinemaware applied their philosophy of lavish production and advanced cutscenes. Exhibition and league matches are on offer, with the opportunity to recreate a full league season with 1 player assigned to each of the 28 clubs. The game uses varying camera positions, with top-down views when the ball is close to either hoop, and a side-view when the ball is mid-court - controls remain unchanged for these, so the switch doesn't cause a sudden change in player movement.

As well as playing the matches you have full coaching control. This can involve making substitutions but also assigning marking and game strategies.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">Before Electronic Arts sought to imitate television coverage of sports with their EA Sports titles, Cinemaware had the same idea, initially applying it to (American) Football. Cutscenes follow dramatic moments in the match, and each match is preceded by a TV-style introduction. The game is primarily action-based, although you also choose your plays before executing them. You then bring the passes and runs to life on the pitch itself. You can play single matches or full leagues, with any of the NFL teams of the time.</synopsis>

            <synopsis>
                <synopsis langue="en">Cinemaware's TV Sports series got an exclusive entry on the TurboGrafx-16 with this hockey game.

The game offers exhibition matches and a tournament mode, eight international teams (each with unique player statistics), and support for up two five players via the TurboTap.

After a dramatic close-up of the face-off, actual game play is seen from a top-down perspective with a vertically scrolling field. Every player (including the goalie) can be controlled. On offense, quick shots, slap shots and even faked slap shots are possible. On defense, body checking an opposing player can lead to a special fight sequence.

Exhibition games can be played with either full or easy rules - easy mode has less penalties and infractions like offside. In tournaments, every scheduled game can either be played or the results simulated. Tournament progress is saved via a password. When two or more players play, they can be put on any team. Thus teams featuring five human players are just as possible as mixed competitive matches.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">Victory Run is an arcade racer based on the Paris-Dakar rally. The gameplay is similar to OutRun, with your car appearing near the bottom of the screen, and a course made of scaling sprites laid out ahead.  

At the start of the race, you choose how many spare engines, tires, brakes, and so on to take with you on the rally. As you finish each segment, you have to decide to use those parts so that you can repair your car so you can complete the race.</synopsis>

                <synopsis langue="en">World Class Baseball is a baseball game. The player controls the pitcher and fielders (through an automatic system that, following baseball games' tradition, gives to him control on the one of the players who is closest to the ball); not the batter. One or two little windows display the runner's status during the face-off between the batter and the pitcher; once the ball is hit the view changes to a bird's eye one, showing a good portion of the game field where the action is taking place, together with a permanent small field's image at the right bottom of the screen displaying the position of every player on the whole field.</synopsis>

The action itself features no big surprises: the players control their characters over the scrolling tennis field and try to counter balls from their opponents. It is possible to perform typical tennis actions like cross, smash or lob and the hit performance depends on the timing.</synopsis>
