        <name>007 - Licence to Kill (128K)</name>
        <desc>A "James Bond" action/arcade game based on the movie with the same name. Your aim is to avenge the death of Felix Leiter, who was killed by the drug baron Sanchez.

Technically the game consists of several different vertical scrolling action sequences. In each stage you must fly, drive or walk through a preset terrain. While doing that, you have to shoot enemies, avoid their shots and collect items (mainly ammunition). Some levels rely more on shooting, while others test your reflexes.

        <desc>Leader Board authors Bruce and Roger Carver tried their hand at tenpin bowling, in one of the game's earliest recreations. The process of bowling the ball involves timing a succession of clicks to set the right angle, speed and curve, similarly to Leaderboard's system. Three skill levels are provided - Kids level sets the speed and hook automatically, while Amateur has more margin for error with hook/slice than professional. The game is played from a plan view, with four other (empty) lanes visible. Single matches or a league structure can be played.

Updates to the gameplay include an energy bar, which can be run down by either being hit from incoming fire or using a special weapon. The energy bar can be replenished by picking up power-ups, while special weapons (lightning, cyclones and waves) can knock down all fighters on the screen at the time.

        <name>3D Starstrike (48K)</name>
        <desc>The Outsiders have attacked the Earth Federation, laying waste to its defense fleets. In desperation, Federation Command sends the new Starstrike space fighters to attack the Outsiders's main bases (which are converted moons), hoping to exploit a fatal flaw in the design: a direct hit to the reactor at the center of the base might lead to its destruction.

Both regarding graphics and gameplay, 3D Starstrike is essentially a clone of Atari's Star Wars. Using wireframe graphics with a first-person perspective, the player controls the Starstrike fighter in several distinct phases: the first phase is the approach to the enemy base, where Outsider space fighters must be destroyed. The second phase takes place close to the surface of the base, where enemy bunkers and laser towers await. The third phase is a trench run, where gun turrets await at the side of the trench, and catwalks blocking the way must be dogded. The run culminates in the reactor room, where two reactor pods must be hit to destroy the base.

After a base is destroyed, the game continues with a new base in the next level, with later levels having a higher difficulty.

Standing in the front of seemingly deserted bridge the main and only task is to stop every enemy tank that's crossing over. You can move left and right (with the tank), up and down (with the gun turret) and fire explosive shells. Aiming of the gun turret and timing of the shot is critical for success because enemy tanks are moving in four distant lines. Also remember that direct hit to the turret is deadly for enemy (as well for you) whilst the tank hit to the hull is immobilised but still able to shoot on you.

        <name>750cc Grand Prix (128K)</name>
        <desc>The action in this motorcycle racing game takes place in a small box of the screen, but there’s a good reason for this – unlike virtually every other 8-bit motorcycle racing game, the screen tilts as you lean the bike into the corner, giving it a much more realistic feel. Six British racetracks are featured, with 3-lap races. You must finish in the top 3 of the 8-bike field to qualify for the next one. You will often need to pit for fuel and tires during the race. The other bikes get quite a head start on you by being able to accelerate more quickly, but the first few are usually quite easy to pass on the first lap.

        <desc>Like the similarly-named C64 game, this driving game puts you in control of a Dunlop-shod Porsche 911. The player must battle through 8 top-view stages packed with obstacles, within a time limit - any remaining time is converted into points. Contact with obstacles (including trees, bicycles and a chasing car) causes damage to accumulate; once this reaches maximum the game is over. 

Before the game starts you can upgrade your car; with £2000 to spend you must choose one (or none) of each of the four categories - tyres, fuel, boost, and handling upgrades such as power-steering and improved brakes. Through trial-and-error you will learn which combinations suit your driving style and the ensuing hazards the most. Further upgrades can be collected on the odd-numbered stages, by driving over them.

        <desc>What's that coming over the hill, is it a monster? Yes, as this Rampage-influenced arcade game sees you play either an ogre or a dragon. Both are searching an island for an egg which will give them super powers. 

This is located inside a building, and to find the right one you must continuously smash them up, using either the ogre's horn or the dragon's tail. Humans must also be attacked as you see them, as their catapults weaken you. Food can be found to restore energy,

Once you have located the egg, a one-on-one beat 'em up battle with your rival ensues - win five of these to finally win the game.

With this attractive argument we became jumbled of such way in the game that until we do not solve it we are condemned to moor itself of permanent form to the computer.

        <desc>This is a top down vertically scrolling shooter, in which you start off as a motorbike. You are quite vulnerable to attack at first, but power ups come in the form of a Sega van which you have to dock with. The first time you dock you get double fire, the second time gives you a rocket, the third gives a rear force field and the fourth invulnerablility.

By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A through to D allows you change into a sportscar which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as nimble. Collect all the letters in order to be able to transform into a high tech plane. This is the final stage of one of the five missions. Only the high tech plane can guide you to your destination in which your main target is hiding.

There is also time limit in which you have to complete the mission. It is advisable to transform into the high tech plane as fast as it is possible.

Picking up flags gives you bonus points with 10,000 points gaining you an extra life.

The fact that you play Airtight gives the game its unusual nature. You control a cursor, which must hit each of the potential threats before Quick Kick gets to them. These include enemies throwing barrels, shooting enemies on foot, and fighters hidden in bins. As Quick Kick completes each screen the display moves on to the next one. Shooting the US flags which occasionally appear will restore Quick Kick's energy.

        <desc>Action Reflex involves steering a bouncy ball through 75 screens of hazards. These include lakes, drains, daggers, and a network of pipes which can send you back several screens. You play against a time limit, and contact with one of these hazards deducts time from your limited amount (there are no 'lives' to worry about), and puts you back at the start of the screen. 

Movement is controlled by moving left and right at increasing speed, and using the fire button to jump vertically. Once the all is aerial, it can be vaulted over hazards through careful steering - the faster the ball is going, the higher it can go, and the longer it takes to bring it back under control - the ball can bounce quite far before being stoppable.

As you play through the game, points bonuses can be collected, which ultimately place useful objects into your possession - keys, hammers and rings, which can be used via an icon system.

Once this is passed, the serious business of shooting down the enemy craft begins. These shoot at you from a distance, and your angle of attack varies depending on the angle at which you are flying into the screen, in a sort of trick-3D. 

Landmines (shoot these before they disintegrate towards you) and flying saucers (which don't shoot at you, but must be shot several times), before the task of noting down a code to enable you to progress to the next moon, from which the whole task begins again with increased difficulty. The game keeps track of how long you have been playing each game, as well as a high score.

In comparison to the other versions of the game this one is more puzzle-oriented, meaning the player has to find keys to access certain parts of the game world. Another big difference is that this version is not side-scrolling, the player is always sees the whole room and the game switches to another one if the player leaves the screen or enters a door.

The table design features extra flippers on both sides, which are at the bases of sections of features. The best scores can be achieved by repeatedly bashing away at sections of blocks.

The essential theme of the table is of magic and wizardry, with the targets to be lit including the word 'MAGIC' as well as a weather potion and a magic cottage. Trapdoors must be shot open to get their bonuses, then shot shut again to prevent the ball being lost in them. Extra balls are offered every 10,000 points.

        <desc>Year 2019, Manhattan. After a nuclear war.  

Out of the ashes comes a hero, Jonathan Rogers, better known as "Jungle Rogers", the owner of the asphalt jungle. The only chance of survival is to reach the airdrop platform XV-238, located in the control base of the schizophrenic assassin professor McJerin, and to escape to outer colonies.

There is no easy way to do this. The game is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up, with thugs coming at you constantly, and a few moves to use on them. You must cross the dangerous streets of Manhattan, which have become over-run by feral thieves. Later he awaits for the guardians of the scientific complex of McJerin.

        <name>After the War - Part 2 (Spanish) (48K)</name>
        <desc>Year 2019, Manhattan. After a nuclear war.  

Out of the ashes comes a hero, Jonathan Rogers, better known as "Jungle Rogers", the owner of the asphalt jungle. The only chance of survival is to reach the airdrop platform XV-238, located in the control base of the schizophrenic assassin professor McJerin, and to escape to outer colonies.

There is no easy way to do this. The game is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up, with thugs coming at you constantly, and a few moves to use on them. You must cross the dangerous streets of Manhattan, which have become over-run by feral thieves. Later he awaits for the guardians of the scientific complex of McJerin.

        <name>Afterburner (128K)</name>
        <desc>Afterburner is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name. The goal is simple: use your F-14 Tomcat and shoot as many enemies as you can. This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the time.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.

You control a ship with Agent Orange on board which when planted will kill the weed. When you land on a planet you can see the killer weed growing. Alien fighters try and stop you sowing Agent Orange. Any fighter destroyed leave behind a seed. Collect the seeds but be careful as carrying too many seeds cause your ship to crash.

        <name>Ah Diddums (48K)</name>
        <desc>Ah Diddums is a single player game with 99 levels in which the player builds ladders to progress to the next level

Teddy isn't in a normal toy-box, he's in the central toy-box of a nested set of 99 boxes, and to get out he must build a set of steps by piling building bricks in a specific order. In his box Teddy hears baby crying and its his job to take toys to the baby to stop her crying. However, if baby stops crying then the mother will turn out the light. The other toys in the toy-box with Ted can only play when the light is on so they try to stop Teddy comforting the baby. Contact with any of these toys will shred Ted and cost a life.

There are weapons available and these will kill the other toys, however killing all the other toys on a level / in a box brings in the invincible lump of plasticine to hamper Ted
Ted's only friend in all this is a jack-in-a-box, Jack jumps out of his box when when Ted touches it and this frightens all the other toys into being still for a short period.
The game screen is a top down view of the toy-box. Scattered around are bricks and other items some of which, like the pea-shooter, are weapons. Other toys patrol the game area and contact with any of these is lethal.

The game is keyboard controlled with an odd arrangement of keys.

1. To move Ted left or right the keys on the CAPS SHIFT to SPACE row are used in alternating order, i.e. CAPS SHIFT, X, V, N move Ted left, Z, C, B, M moves right.
2. To move TED up the screen, or to pick up objects, alternating keys on the Q to P row are used, so keys Q, E, T, U, O will move Ted, while keys W,R, Y, I, &amp; P will make Ted pick up an object.
3. To move Ted down the screen or to fire a weapon the keys on the A to ENTER row are used, A, D, G, J &amp; L moving Ted while the remainder fire the weapon. 
4. the keys 1 to 0 can be used to pause the game at any time

        <desc>In this action/simulation game by Microprose the player takes the role of an U.S. Army airborne ranger. These Airborne rangers are dropped behind enemy lines by parachute to perform all kinds of dangerous missions. Gameplay consists of 3 phases:
Reading the mission briefing and outfitting 3 supply pods with machine gun ammo, time bombs, first-aid kits, grenades &amp; LAW rockets depending on this briefing.
2. Flying over the mission map in a V-22 Osprey plane to drop your 3 supply pods and parachuting out of the plane yourself.
3. Performing the actual missions and reaching the pick-up point before time runs out. There are 12 different missions which include capturing an enemy officer, blowing up an ammunition depot, photographing an experimental aircraft and liberating P.O.W.'s

Missions take place in either an arctic, desert or temperate setting. Using the mission map the player must decide the route towards the mission objective. This might require them to crawl through trenches, run around minefields or take out enemy soldiers and bunkers. Airborne Ranger was one of the first games with some missions that required a stealthy approach (staying undetected until a certain time, taking out a guard and stealing an enemy uniform etc.).

Airborne Ranger can be played in practice or veteran mode. In practice mode, gameplay is limited to a single mission, while in veteran mode, a series of missions or an entire campaign is played in order to earn medals &amp; promotions. All missions can be played on several difficulty levels.

Plenty of beings are out there to stop him, and spells can be cast to vanquish these - your spell energy constantly restores, so finding quiet spaces to wait for it to recharge can be beneficial. By pushing down into the ground, you can turn into an eagle so as to fly across gaps, although activating this mode takes a bit of energy, and you can't use spells while eaglified. Pushing into the ground returns you to human form.

        <name>Alien Storm (128K)</name>
        <desc>The aliens are invading Earth, and it's up to the "Alien Busters" to wipe them out and destroy their creator. The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons and special attacks.

When you start the game, you can select any one of these characters to play as. There are six missions to complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several stages, and each mission has you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet the mother of all aliens. Unfortunately, blasting these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get tougher in every mission, and are capable of hiding into objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people destroying an UFO.

When you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which you can shoot to collect life or energy (by the way, life is important to you, since if yours get empty, you're dead). However, rather than using your ordinary weapons, you can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you currently see. These types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of the game. For instance, Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs across the street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of his present location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow up aliens on sight, he will then re-appear. However, using your character's special attack uses up a lot of energy, and if you have little or no energy, you can't use it.

At the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to complete the mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings where you participate in a shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens popping up from several locations with the building. 

You can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with another person.

        <name>Aliens (UK Version) (48K)</name>
        <desc>Electric Dreams' game based on the 1986 film Aliens is a first-person strategy game somewhat similar to Space Hulk. The player controls six characters from a remote terminal, guiding them through a 255-room complex in search of the Alien Queen. Each character has a helmet camera and a smart gun, each controlled by the player acting in the role of overall operational commander.

The player can switch to any character at any time, and must consider coordinating their movements and finding a safe location before switching to the next character. Characters occupy one room at a time, and can pan their view a full 360-degrees inside each room. Doors can be locked to halt Alien progress, or blasted open to get through (at the cost of permanently destroying the door). Alien bio-mass must also be destroyed before it spawns facehuggers, and the Aliens themselves leave lethal puddles of acid when killed (and so shouldn't be killed in front of doors!) 

Aliens prowl the complex and are attracted to gunfire. They will home in on nearby characters and attack, requiring the player to aim that character's gun to defend against the rushing Alien (a headshot kills instantly, while three to the body do the same).  If an Alien attacks a character the player is not controlling, they will "capture" that character (indicated by a yellow status light).  The player must guide another character to the position of the hostage and kill the guarding Alien to rescue them.  If not, the captured character will be lost.

Ammunition for all characters is limited, and refilled only by making a trip to the complex's armory. Similarly, a medical bay can replenish any damage. Characters also have limited stamina, used up with every move made. When stamina is low, the player must find a safe spot for that character to rest up. The complex also houses a generator controlling the lights, which the Aliens can destroy, or the Marines can then repair.

        <desc>In this coin-op conversion, you are a hero raised from the dead by the god Zeus to rescue his daughter Athena. With a scenery inspired by Ancient Greece, you have to fight hordes of undead and demons, with a boss at the end of each level until you meet the god Neff, who holds the girl captive.

The title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human form.

The game can be played in singleplayer mode, or in same-screen multiplayer co-op mode.

This is done by chasing them and sounding your siren at them - in some cases they will need ramming off the road.  There are also hardened criminals to catch - if you can get one of these to confess, your day's work is considered done.

The game's action is presented with an overhead view of your squad car. Car upgrades are available, to be brought from your reward money. You earn Demerits by crashing, wrongly arresting innocents, or failing to meet your quota. Too many demerits and it is game over.

        <desc>Aquaplane is a side-scrolling action game loosely based around water skiing. You control a motor boat, which must be steered around the hazards and accelerated as necessary. However, the real challenge is that  the man behind it moves with it, but often in subtly different directions, meaning that smaller gaps can be quite treacherous to move through. On the first stage, the hazards are mere rocks, but you'll soon have to account for motorboats, yachts and sharks moving across your path.

        <desc>In Nodes of Yesod, a monolith was discovered on the moon that transferred data vital to earth's security to an alien planet. After an attempt to destroy the monolith failed, it was transported to its creators the Ariatans. Now it is up to Charlie to travel to the planet Ariat and prevent the Ariatans from accessing the data.

Gameplay in Arc of Yesod is very similar to its predecessor. Seen from a side-scrolling perspective, Charlie has to explore many large caverns, filled with enemies and transporters, and find eight crystals that he hopes will help him destroy the monolith for good. To get rid of his enemies, he can once again control a device similar to the mole in Nodes of Yesod. Pressing up on the joystick releases a small sphere that can be moved across the screen (while Charlie stands still) and shoot at enemies. Once again, there are enemies that are immune to the sphere, including a spaceman who, when touched, takes away one of Charlie's crystals.

        <desc>Arcadia is a space shoot 'em up along the lines of Galaxians and Space Invaders. You have a ship at the bottom of the screen. Enemy ships come at you in waves scrolling across the screen from right to left.
There are eight levels. When the last level has been completed the game cycles to level one again and continues with no increase in difficulty.
You get an extra life if you clear 4 waves. They keep on coming and the object is to get a high score.

Interesting key mapping on this game:  the bottom row of keys moves left &amp; right, but they are mapped alternately so Z, C, B, M and SPACE move you right while CAP SHIFT, X, V, N, and  SYMBOL SHIFT move you left. The middle row of keys (A, S, D, etc) power the thrusters while the top row (Q, W, E, etc) fire the dual lasers

        <name>Arkanoid (48K)</name>
        <desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.

The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.

By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.

Nuclear tracers fall from the top of the screen leaving behind a trail and as you move a cross-hair around the screen, you must fire a limited supply of missiles and allow them to explode in front of each trail to destroy them. If a nuclear tracer hits a city then it is destroyed and if all cities are destroyed then it is game over. A plane occasionally flies over the screen from left to right and you get bonus points for destroying it. Once a wave is over then bonus points are awarded for any cities and missiles left before being re-armed and you then protect the remaining cities from another attack.</desc>

Then, you fly around in a helicopter and the oject is to bring down airplanes without being shot at by the airplanes themselves, submarines, and any other ground fire. Make sure you land on the pad near the end.

In part two, you start out in the jungle and must jump from rock to rock without crashing into toucans (shoot at them to make them fly higher) and being blown to bits. Then you have to make your way to the general's offices shooting soldiers on the way, and finally, locate the secret documents. When you complete the seven sections of Army Moves, you'll receive a higher bonus.

Some versions have a high score table to record your achievements. The second section must be loaded seperately, using a code attained from completing part one, on some versions.

        <name>Aspar GP Master (Spanish) (48K)</name>
        <desc>A motorcycle racing game recreating the now-defunct 80cc world motorcycle racing championship. It was licensed around Spanish ace Jorge Martinez 'Aspar', and your (and his) racing rivals including future 500cc World Champion Alex Criville.

The game features a full practice mode as well as qualifying and races. There are only 8 computer bikes, although the real life championship points system is used, meaning that the penalty for not finishing is bigger than in real life, especially as you only have 5 bikes to last the season. The game is viewed from overhead, and the controls are, unusually, direction based, so to take a straight which (in the overhead view) involves going up and to the right, you must push the joystick in that direction.

        <name>Asterix and the Magic Cauldron (48K)</name>
        <desc>Goscinny and Uderzo’s cartoon characters are from the only Gaullish village in 50BC able to resist the Roman invasion. They can do this due to Getafix the druid’s magic potion, however the cauldron used to make this has been smashed into several pieces. Can brave Asterix and overweight Obelix find the pieces?

In this arcade adventure, it all comes down to you. The fifty screens you must explore take in your home village, a Roman encampment, and the forests in between. You have five pieces of wild boar, and these are used as you become hungry. 

Contact with wild boars or Roman soldiers triggers a one-on-one fight with punches and kicks. Defeating a boar earns you another piece of food, to restore energy once all lives are gone. Some sections are blocked until you collect their keys.

In the US version the character Asterix was replaced by a barbarian and the game's title was changed to Ardok the Barbarian.

        <desc>As the game begins, you fall through a trapdoor and end up inside an evil castle with only one way to get out of it - find all the pieces of the great ACG key that lets you unlock the main door.

Many problems lie on your way to freedom, however - not only is the castle pretty big and spread out over several floors, it is also littered with enemies that must be avoided or dispensed of. For some doors, you need keys to open them.

This game pioneered in several ways - the mix of fast-paced action and exploration of the large castle with little "puzzles" was innovative at that time, and you got to choose a character class, each one with its own weapon and skills - each class had different secret routes and shortcuts through the castle.

The game features a succession of courses, which must be navigated in 30 seconds. You must run to the vehicle initially, and will also have to manually remount if you fall off - all costing you more precious time. Careful use of the wheelies and jumps is crucial to completion. Each hazard must be taken at the right speed, which you'll learn through experience.

        <desc>In Monty On the Run the intrepid coal thief Monty Mole fled to the rocky island of Gibraltar. However, the Intermole agency is on to him, and his only hope of escape is to trek across Europe, collecting enough cash to buy the Greek island of Montoss and live there in luxury.

This is Monty's third game, and the structure is similar to the previous two. It's platform and ladders based, with 80 screens each representing some area of Europe - the Eiffel Tower and the Leaning Tower of Pisa are among the identifiable landmarks. 

There are different ways of travelling through the levels - some bouncy platforms coupled with a new super-leap move allow for big progress to be made, while Monty can also suspend from the ceilings and dodge his way across. Monty can now fall without being hurt, although landing on water can cause multiple lives to be lost in quick succession.

There are many items to collect  - the most important are Eurocheques for money and airplane tickets. Once on a plane you must fight off the encroaching Intermole planes for extra points.

You control Maroc's astral projection which can cast spells to achieve various parts of the quest, the objective is to advance in sixteen ranks by exploring the world and collecting spells and ultimately destroy the Lord of Chaos.

Maroc starts outside a castle where a spell descends upon him and projects his astral projection inside it. The projection can only act or move through the use of spells.The two basic spells are movement and servant spells. The move spell allows the projection to move around and the servant spell summons a spirit that can move about and collect objects or other spells for Maroc. Only up to four objects can be carried around at a time and there are around 220 locations on eight levels. Enemies will attack the projection and drain it's energy which can be replenished with a spell, if depleted the projection is destroyed and the game reverts to Maroc outside the castle, ready for another go.</desc>

        <desc>A supercomputer in the most remote part of a distant galaxy has become crazy and threatens to destroy the planet. You have been chosen to be the central link of the support command which will try to give a solution for it. But don't worry, you have been educated and trained in the Golden Ring space station, the hardest survival school of the galactic confederation.

Besides, your ship is equipped with the ultimate devices which will allow you to travel safely by the well-known universe. The Combat Mode, where you can activate a panel with a system to locate and to destroy your enemies and the Control System via Menus, both make La Aventura Espacial a new concept in the graphic-conversational adventure.

First of all, your mission is to find your companions, whom are distributed by all the universe, and together with them you must arrive to the central base of the Dark Threat. There, you will have to deal one on one with the computer. It's not an easy task, but you are the last hope of the humanity. All the galaxy has its destiny in your hands.

        <name>Aventura Espacial, La - Explorando Mundos (Spanish) (48K)</name>
        <desc>A supercomputer in the most remote part of a distant galaxy has become crazy and threatens to destroy the planet. You have been chosen to be the central link of the support command which will try to give a solution for it. But don't worry, you have been educated and trained in the Golden Ring space station, the hardest survival school of the galactic confederation.

Besides, your ship is equipped with the ultimate devices which will allow you to travel safely by the well-known universe. The Combat Mode, where you can activate a panel with a system to locate and to destroy your enemies and the Control System via Menus, both make La Aventura Espacial a new concept in the graphic-conversational adventure.

First of all, your mission is to find your companions, whom are distributed by all the universe, and together with them you must arrive to the central base of the Dark Threat. There, you will have to deal one on one with the computer. It's not an easy task, but you are the last hope of the humanity. All the galaxy has its destiny in your hands.

        <name>Aventura Original - Parte 1 - La Busqueda (Spanish) (48K)</name>
        <desc>In the mid-'70s, an unusual phenomenon took place: two Americans, Willie Crowther and Don Woods wrote the first text adventure game: it was the Original Adventure and was written in Fortran for a DEC PDP-10 and occupied more than 300 K of memory. It gathered a cult following from the elite programmers who knew how to connect to the data bank where it was located, and like all cults, it had its first "martyrs"; several important programmers were fired after becoming "addicted" to it, found playing it late at night while understood to be working overtime instead.

In the United States it was the base that inspired Scott Adams to begin with his famous adventures. In Great Britain, Peter Austin, founder of Level 9, the most prestigious English adventure game company, confessed to be impelled by it from his beginnings as a game designer (one of his first adventures was a version of the Original Adventure). In Spain, there was a similar story, since the first Spanish company dedicated exclusively to text adventures (Aventuras AD), made its reputation based on a game curiously called "La Aventura Original" (yes, based on the legendary one), the fruit of 8 months of investigation and work.

This version, aside from being in Spanish, has with several points worth mentioning, such as having more than 100 detailed locations with graphical illustrations; a special routine of exit descriptions (indispensable for guiding the adventurer through this complex world); and the possibility of using accents, "ñ"'s and opening interrogation and exclamation signs. As well, every object of your inventory is described in text and graphic form. The characters also use the PSI system, so they are not mere objects with human names, but will listen to you and respond -- but most importantly, will act according to how you treat them.

        <desc>B.C. Bill is a collect-em-up about the daily struggles of our ancestors. As the caveman Bill, you must compete with other contemporary species, such as the dinosaurs, to collect food. Whack the food with your club and drag the food back to your cave before a dinosaur eats it – or you. But food alone is not enough for survival, you must also hunt cave-wives to secure your offspring. The procedure is the same here: hit the women with your club before they're eaten by a dinosaur, and drag them by their hair back to the cave. Your score is calculated according to how many seasons you've survived, how many wives and how much offspring you have.

Having managed to steal your report during the last few skooldaze of term, you've spent the whole holiday forging teachers' signatures and handwriting to make yourself look like the brightest, sweetest natured, most helpful little soul ever to carry a satchel.... Now all you've got to do is get it back into the Headmasters's safe!

Back to Skool follows the same gameplay style as its predecessor, but this time the school is bigger (there's a girl's section to explore) and there's a larger cast of characters. There's also more to do this time around, with more objectives to complete before you can finish the game.

        <name>Back to the Future (48K)</name>
        <desc>Based on the 1985 time travel flick, Electric Dreams' Back to the Future for the Commodore 64 (and ported to the ZX Spectrum) differs significantly from LJN's version on the NES.

The player takes control of teenager Marty McFly; zapped into the past by an experiment gone wrong. To preserve Marty's future existence, the player must lure Marty's mother-to-be into spending more time with his father, while avoiding the school bully. These computer-controlled characters will wander the game areas and interact with each other according to basic rules - Marty's mother will follow him around, his father will avoid the bully, the bully will knock Marty out if their paths should cross, etc.  If left to their own devices, Marty's parents will not meet and his time will run out (indicated by a fading family photo).  

The game world consists of five distinct areas, each the size of one screen. A separate &amp;quot;hub&amp;quot; area scrolls past the entrances to these five zones. Each of the five areas holds a collectable item, with a different effect (attract, repel, or no effect) on each character. A skateboard can also be collected to travel across the hub faster.

The player must use their collected items to keep Marty's mother and father in close proximity, while also keeping the bully away.

        <desc>Back to the Future II is a collection of five arcade and puzzle games.

Based on the second installment of the popular Hollywood series Back to the Future, this movie conversion has Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel through time to stop their arch-rival Biff from changing the future. The game consists of five parts, each inspired by one of the movie's most memorable scenes:

1. Hoverboard Chase: A Paperboy clone without newspapers, but with isometric levels and lots of enemies to dodge.
2. Jennifer Rescue: Guide Marty's girlfriend Jennifer out of the house without her meeting one of the four family members. Open and close doors to make the persons go from one room to the next in this top-down puzzle sequence.
3. Beat Biff: A side-scrolling beat-em-up sequence in the tradition of Double Dragon. Fight your way through a grim 1985 by jumping, hitting and kicking at Biff's lackeys.
4. Band Puzzle: Rearrange the mixed-up parts of an animated picture of the school band in this sliding block puzzle. The clock is ticking.
5. Hoverboard Chase 2: Another hoverboard sequence, similar to the first one, only this time set in 1955.

        <desc>Back to the Future III is a collection of four arcade games. Marty McFly and Doc Brown have traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and they're soon deep in trouble when they face "Mad Dog" Tannen's gang and have to find a way to return to the present. This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences:

1. Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective.

2. Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.

3. Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back.

4. The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.

The races consist of 3 souped-up cars toughing it out over 4 laps on one of the 8 tracks, which are viewed from above. Two human players can take part, but only the winner continues without using up credits, so you will only see the early races in two-player mode. 

You are armed with guns, which can be used to slow opposing cars. During the races spanners can be collected, which are then cashed in for upgraded turbos, improved weaponry and engine upgrades. Hazards on the later tracks include ramps, bridges, buildings collapsing onto the track and barriers which open and close in a random sequence.

        <desc>In this game you play the role of a barbarian who must navigate his way through dangerous dungeons. The game is played from a third person side scrolling perspective and also has platform jumping parts to it. The barbarian is controlled by using left and right on the joystick to move and up and down is used to scroll through the various commands at the bottom of the screen.
When a command is highlighted pressing fire will perform that action thus saving on extra buttons being needed to play. There are two weapons at your disposal. A sword which you start the game with and later a bow which is handy for long range attacks. There are many traps to avoid and various monsters who have different attack patterns.

Unlike its predecessor, Barbarian II features only a single-player mode, in which the player assumes the role of either sword-wielding Princess Mariana or the titular savage, who is armed with a battleaxe. Their common quest is to pursue the evil wizard Drax, who has fled to his dungeon hideout after his defeat in the first game. The player characters battle their way through an inhospitable wasteland, a system of caves, and a dungeon before facing Drax in his inner sanctum for a showdown.</desc>

        <desc>Burger Time clearly influenced this manic arcade action game, in which your task is to make burgers, by collecting the 4 core components in sequence. Chasing you as you do this are two sausages and eggs, contact with which costing you a life. You are armed with a pepper spray, which paralyzes them for a few seconds, but this is limited to five uses per level. When you touch the burger pieces, they drop, and can be used as weapons to stop the pursuing foods. The arrangement of platforms features many ladders, which you must use to chase and dodge the respective ingredients,

        <name>Basil the Great Mouse Detective (48K)</name>
        <desc>Based on the 1986 Walt Disney animated movie, the story revolves around a mouse named Basil who lives in the basement of the famous Sherlock Holmes residence 221B Baker Street.  Basil's friend Dr. Dawson has been kidnapped by the villainous Professor Ratigan and he must search through London for clues that will lead him to the fiend's lair.

The game is a colorful platform adventure through 3 locales:  London's shops and docks, the sewers and finally the den of Ratigan.  In each area, 5 clues must be found by exploring objects such bags and sacks, cans, jars and chests found in each screen with Basil's magnifying glass.  He must pick up clues to fill 5 pockets in his coat and then he will be able to determine if some are fake (as Ratigan has scattered 8 fake clues among each locale).  Fake ones must be dropped until all 5 real clues are found then you get a clue to the level exit to go to the next locale.  If you can't find the exit, each clue can give a hint as to what direction you should go in.  

Your energy runs down as you go through the multi-level platform screens and encounter Rattigan's goons but some objects will contain cheese which restores energy or mousetraps which when laid in path of the goons will make them harmless (though they take up a pocket until used).

Initially Batman lacks his super powers, which must be collected. The Batbag allows you to pick up and drop objects, Jet Batboots allow you to jump, the Thruster allows Road-Runnering (movement while you fall), and the Low Gravity Batbelt keeps you in the air for longer.

Short-term bonuses of invincibility, extra energy, and extra life and an enhanced jump can be collected, but there is also one which neutralises all power-ups. You have eight lives, but each cluster of Batstones acts as a restart point - when it is game over you can return to that spot, with lives and equipment as they were.

Part one, the chemical plant: Hunt down Jack Napier who has raided the plant (typical platform action, climb ladders or use "Bat"-rope and shoot at some enemies...). Part two, "Batmobile" (...the car): Joker is chasing you and have to escape to "Bat"-cave. Avoid obstacles like police blocking the road and others. Part three, "Bat"-cave: A puzzle game where you have to find a certain item (belonging to Joker) amongst other items. Part four, "Batjet": Cut the ropes of the balloons which are filled with poisonous gas. Part five, the cathedral: Hunt down Joker. This part plays like the first one. Finally you will confront Joker in a fight that decides the fate of Gotham city.

        <name>Batty (48K)</name>
        <desc>Batty is influenced by Arkanoid's method of reviving the Breakout phenomenon. You control a paddle at the bottom of the screen, with the top half of the screen containing an arrangement of bricks, most of which can be destroyed. You must move the paddle left and right so as to make contact with a ball, and thus deflect it (using the walls at the sides strategically) into the bricks, some of which require multiple hits to destroy. Wipe the destructible bricks out, and you move on to the next level; fail to keep the ball in play and you lose one of your 5 lives.

Some destroyed bricks release power-up tokens, which must be 'caught' with the bat as they fall. Functions include multi-ball, a larger paddle, and the ability to 'catch' and relaunch the ball each time, which makes it a lot easier to gain access to precise bricks or areas.

Batty also has enemies flying around and dropping bombs towards you - the bombs cause your bat to stick for a second, perhaps costing a life. Many levels contain magnets at the top of the screen, which make the ball's path harder to predict. The two player mode gives each player access to half the playfield, so co-operation is required.

You have a set amount of fuel and you must collect fuel canisters to replenish it and maintain your speed. Should your fuel count reach zero you will go slow until you collect a canister which would also cost you time. You also cannot fire with your fuel empty. If you complete all eight rounds the game loops over and you begin at round one again. If you fail to complete any round within the time limit, your game is over.</desc>

        <name>Benny Hill's Madcap Chase! (128K) (Hack)</name>
        <desc>The late comic's risque TV show usually saw him dashing around frantically chasing after scantily-clad ladies half his age and half his weight. Colour-clashing bras would lack beauty, however, so the licensed game instead sees Benny attempting to carry out 3 levels of work for the community (he was a nice guy at heart). Unfortunately, his generosity is misconstrued as theft, so you'll have to flee as quickly as possible.

On level 1 he is taking laundry from the clothesline to the laundry basket, item by item, avoiding the local busybody, on level 2 he gathers apples whilst being chased by a tractor, and on level 3 he collects bric-a-brac, much to the police's panic.

The graphics are large and blocky, using a similar style to Don Priestley's Popeye license for DK'Tronics. The gameplay takes place on 3 depths of each side-view flick-screen, with obstacles such as lamp-posts often blocking one of those levels, requiring a quick move into the screen. Contact with these obstacles costs time, which is vital when you're being chased to your target.

        <name>Benny Hill's Madcap Chase! (48K)</name>
        <desc>The late comic's risque TV show usually saw him dashing around frantically chasing after scantily-clad ladies half his age and half his weight. Colour-clashing bras would lack beauty, however, so the licensed game instead sees Benny attempting to carry out 3 levels of work for the community (he was a nice guy at heart). Unfortunately, his generosity is misconstrued as theft, so you'll have to flee as quickly as possible.

On level 1 he is taking laundry from the clothesline to the laundry basket, item by item, avoiding the local busybody, on level 2 he gathers apples whilst being chased by a tractor, and on level 3 he collects bric-a-brac, much to the police's panic.

The graphics are large and blocky, using a similar style to Don Priestley's Popeye license for DK'Tronics. The gameplay takes place on 3 depths of each side-view flick-screen, with obstacles such as lamp-posts often blocking one of those levels, requiring a quick move into the screen. Contact with these obstacles costs time, which is vital when you're being chased to your target.

        <desc>This platform romp has similarities to Ghosts 'N Goblins, sending you on a journey to defeat the forces of evil. You start the game with nine lives, and you'll need them although there are only 3 (large) levels, each finishing with a boss. All manner of monsters block your path and must be attacked with your horizontally-travelling daggers. Additional weapons can be collected, as can bonus orbs, and the chance to summon a spirit to attack for you on the toughest sections.

        <name>Big Trouble in Little China (48K)</name>
        <desc>In this tie-in to the 1986 John Carpenter movie starring Kurt Russell, you must thwart the evil plans of Mandarin Lo Pan who has kidnapped two green-eyed girls in order to marry and sacrifice them in order to become mortal again.  You play as 3 characters, one at a time, in this action platformer: 

- Jack Burton, a burly but bit dumb action hero who fights with fists and later with a "Bushmaster" gun.  Ammo must be found to be able to keep using it.

- Wang Chi, whose girlfriend along with Jack's has been kidnapped, uses Martial Arts and later a sword when found.  More swords will be needed as they will break after awhile.

- Egg Shen is a magician who has vowed to stop the ancient prophecy from coming about, and fights with magic bolts which can turn later on into more powerful lightning if magic potions are found.  

Each character has an energy status bar at bottom of screen represented by a Yin and Yang Symbol that slowly disappears but can be replenished by finding food.  A weapons symbol is shown if they possess it and magic potion symbol will give them extra strength if found.  You must alternate among the 3 characters to keep their status from falling too low and dying, and each has to pick up their own appropriate weapons.  They all can move forwards and backwards, jump, duck and attack at different heights.

They have to fight through several levels including the streets of Chinatown, where martial artist enemies await and gunmen that must be avoided until more experience is gathered. Further on, you go into the sewers where additional monsters must be avoided by jumping over them.  Then they will reach the rooms of the underground lair of Lo Pan where large-hat wearing elementals called Storms await.  The final battle takes place in the Marriage chamber where armoured warriors and the levitating Lo Pan must be vanquished in order to free the kidnapped girls.

        <desc>Footsy the Bigfoot has vowed to rescue his girlfriend, who has been locked inside a cage by a sadistic madman. To set her free, Footsy must blow the lock open using TNT, but the only problem with this is that there are two breaks in the cable that need to be repaired. So Footsy has to walk through a series of environments in an attempt to repair the cable. In the meantime, he has to jump over lava pools, throw rocks at swarms of bees, and eat spinach and fairy cakes to replenish energy he may lose along the way.

        <desc>Black Lamp is a platform game in which you have to find and collect several colored lamps and bring them back, one by one, to a case located in the first room. There are also several types of bonuses to collect along the way, and many enemies and creatures (some flying) to fight off. The ultimate goal is to bring all the colored lamps back to the case, including the elusive Black Lamp.

The Black Lamp world is presented as a collection of rooms, all connected with ladders and/or doors, as well as outside areas where you must defend yourself by shooting or avoiding the attacking creatures.

The graphics are very sharp and colorful, and all fireplaces, candles and torches are animated.

But, as always, you need to collect coins, which can be obtained by destroying certain monsters or breaking a series of pots.

Gameplay follows the usual pattern for Ikari Warriors-style games - kill off the bazooka-toting baddies, which emerge from hiding places or enter the screen in waves. You can do this by either shooting them or running them over with your tank. Parts of the scenery often block your path and need destroying. Once you clear the level you are confronted by a boss, which in the first level is an enormous tank which you have to disable the guns of.

He does this by collecting the right objects to cast the all important spells.

The levels themselves scroll sideways and are layered with platforms. Making the task difficult are spiders, mice and the like - watch out in particular for the jumping frogs. Once the appropriate spells have been cast (involving lots of back-tracking to collect objects and bring them to the cauldron) the objects to make an underwater diving suit must be obtained.

        <name>Block-Dizzy (48K)</name>
        <desc>Calm yourselves, O acolytes of enlightenment and true Specdom. This swish reader game from Arno 'Brainsport' van der Hulst doesn't feature
Vic Reeves or that ghastly squirt of a sentient egg. It does however feature loads and loads of blocks. And playing it a lot does tend to
make you dizzy. Hence the incredibly straightforward name. Obvious, really, if you think about it. (The Dizzy bit is probably a blind, or
a cunning bit of misdirection, or a very silly mistake, or a joke, or the dutch for orange or something)
The idea is to plonk together three or more blocks of one colour. This will cause 'em to disappear mysteriously from the playing arena. Spook, eh? You can't alter the orientation of the blocks - instead, by pressing fire, the three colours in each block rotate. Get the idea? Once you've connected enough blocks so that the number on the right of the screen reaches zero, you're onto the next level. Hurrah! In fact, Hurrah with an extra cherry on top!
Some handy-dandy menus give you a choice of skill levels, cheat modes and start screens as well as info about special blocks you'll come across, which is really nice of them and something that deserves around of applause. Ooer, nearly forgot - don't choose the Kempston joystick option. It won't work, y'see. (Ah me, there's always something, isn't there?)</desc>

        <desc>This is an overhead-viewed racing game similar in style to Super Sprint. There are 7 courses of increasing difficulty, incorporating ramps and bumps which significantly affect the bike's handling. Each course has a time limit you must complete 3 laps of the course within, or it's game over. The further inside the time limit you are, the more points you score.

There's a computer opponent, but the scoring isn't affected by whether you beat him just so long as you qualify. There is a two-player mode. A unique feature at the time is the action replay, which can be viewed in slow motion.

        <desc>Bobby Bearing is a young steel ball who lives in the land Technofear, carefully avoiding the dangerous Metaplanes. One day his evil cousin comes along and lures him and his four brothers directly into said Metaplanes and leaves them for good. So Bobby's quest of the day is to find his way home and rescue his brothers.

The Metaplanes are a big maze of isometric screens without scrolling. The main challenge is to find orientation in this maze with various dead ends and junctions; there are also lifts, magnets, air ducts and hidden switches to complicate matters. There are also enemies and traps to avoid, e.g. evil marbles, crushing blocks of stone or hard to navigate places with opportunities to fall off the screen.

When Bobby finds one of his brothers, Bobby has to roll him to the exit. There are no lives or energy bars to be found in this game: it simply has to be completed before time runs out. Dying or getting stunned by an enemy results in a time penalty. Similarly the player can easily restart a screen with a time penalty if he has manoeuvred himself into an unwinnable situation.</desc>

        <desc>In Bomb Jack, the player controls Jack, who must collect all the bombs in order to complete the current round and go onto the next one. This sounds easy, right? Wrong! Making Jack's task difficult are numerous enemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs.

In each round, collecting a number of bombs results in a bonus coin appearing, and collecting this coin will make the player's score increase 2 to 4 times. More often than not, the "power ball" appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat enemies and have more time to collect all the bombs. There is also the "E" coin, which gives Jack one additional life, but rarely does this coin appear.

The more you progress through the game, the more difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more quickly to get you.

        <desc>Having saved the world in the first game, Bomb Jack is out to collect as much gold as possible, which is lying on a number of ledges. These vary between open and shut - the open ones offer more points, and an extra life is on offer for collecting 10 in a row, so if possible the route should take in the open ones in order.

Gameplay differs from the original, in that Bombjack's movement is no longer free and self-propelled. Instead, he moves flick-style between ledges, so long as one is directly within one of the 4 compass directions. Baddies can be pushed off ledges, but this uses up some of Jack's limited energy.

        <desc>Mobo and Robo Bonanza are enjoying their favorite television show when the picture crackles and a shadowy figure of a mysterious stranger appears on screen. This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.

As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.

        <desc>Like any good pirate ship, the old vessel upon which Booty is set is overloading with treasure, and you play Jim the Cabin Boy as he tries to collect as much of this as he can. The ship is viewed side-on in a platform-type perspective, and contains 20 holds, each of which is split across 8 screens of treasure. Once you have cleared each one, you have 45 seconds to escape the hold and prepare for the next one.

The levels all feature lots of doors, each of which has its own key to open it - these are numbered. As only one key can be held at a time (pick another up and the first one returns to its original location), and many of the enemies are located behind doors, a great deal of strategy as to which order you collect these in is required.

You start with a squad of 12 players, whose names can be changed, but have room for 15 players in total, with chances to buy and sell players. You can take out a bank loan, the level of which depends on your division.

The team's formation can be customised, and as outfield players are not limited to a single position, you can customise the team's strengths and weaknesses in quite a precise way. Matches are played out by listing scorers as they happen, and are followed by a full list of the division's other results. Finances change after each match to to wages, gate receipts, and possible incidents such as riots and illegal player approaches.

        <desc>The third part of the popular series, Boulder Dash III adds a sci-fi spin to the graphics (called MetalGrafik), with Rockford now wearing a spacesuit and running through a more futuristic setting.

Other than that, the 16 new scenarios are similar in gameplay to the levels of Boulder Dash I and II: Rockford still digs through a series of caves to retrieve diamonds. Once he has enough diamonds, a portal opens that takes him to the next stage. Obstacles in the caves include boulders, monsters which will kill Rockford upon touching them (but which can be eradicated by crushing them with falling boulders - some of the monsters then release a number of diamonds), and green slime that spreads through the entire cave and blocks pathways. Additionally, every level has a time limit. Several puzzle elements add variety to the game, such as walls which will turn falling boulders into diamonds.

        <desc>Bounces is a futuristic sports game.  Two players (one of which can be computer-controlled), compete against each other to earn points.  Each game consists of two halves of 90 seconds each, one from each side of the screen.  The winner is simply the player with the most points.

There are two ways of earning points.  The first of which is to catch the bounces ball that bounces around the arena, and throw it through the goal slots, on your opponent's side of the screen.  The further into your opponent's half of the screen the slot is, the more points it is worth, bur the more difficult it is to get the ball into, particular as each player is attached to their side of the screen by a wire.

The second way is to knock your opponent down, either with your fists, or with the ball.  Being knocked down reduces stamina, as  does straying too far into the other player's side of the screen, or colliding with the wall each player is attached to.  If either player runs out of stamina, they are unresponsive until they recover.

        <desc>In Bounder, the player controls a tennis ball that constantly bounces on the screen. 

The player has to move the ball around between two bounces so it lands on friendly areas like grass or the main hexagonal-patterned floor. If it lands  hazardous areas like spikes and sand, or hits the enemies which move around, one of the seven lives the player starts with is lost. There are beneficial squares though - arrows which keep the ball in the air longer or teleports which clear part of the game. 

The 174 screens are divided into 10 levels - at the end of each of these there's a bonus screen.

        <desc>Bounty Bob Strikes Back! is the sequel to Miner 2049er and features similar gameplay. As Bounty Bob, your goal is to claim every inch of 25 challenging mines. To do this, you must walk over each segment of the framework in the mines. To reach each segment of framework, you will need to figure out a way to jump, climb, or use one of the many devices occasionally available to get there. To you help you get around (or sometimes hinder progress) are ladders, slides, suction tubes, cannons, transporters, and other devices. Wandering about the mines are many dangerous mutants. If you come in contact with one of these, you will lose a life. Scattered throughout each mine are special food items; collect one of these, and you will temporarily be able to eliminate the mutants by walking into them. You will need to figure out a unique strategy for each level in order to complete it, plus there is a time limit so claim all the territory quickly!

        <desc>The planet of New Texas is similar to the Wild West-era Texas - mystic Indians, bar-room brawlers and sharp-shooting mercenaries. The only man tough enough to keep order in such a place is Marshall Bravestarr. Stampede is the villain of the piece; he aims to bring the dead back to life as zombies for his own use.

BraveStarr is a side-scrolling action title based on the popular 80's space western cartoon series. Starting with a limited amount of time, you must find and rescue Shamen who was captured by the evil Tex Hex, to aid Stampede's plans. You get nine minutes to complete your task.

The game begins in Fort Kerium in front of the bar. You can enter buildings, to talk to people and examine rooms. Outside, you must jump around, shoot enemies and collect various power-ups they drop. Marshall BraveStarr has only one life - when he takes damage, he loses time instead of life energy.

        <desc>The late martial arts hero features in this platform game, with the aim of reaching a wizard in an underground lair, defeat of whom can offer him untold wealth. 

In each area you must collect the many strategically-placed lanterns before exiting through the newly-revealed passageway. Some rooms also have escalator-type sections to run along, and the standard (although slightly illogical in this context) ladders. 

On the way, you'll fight two enemies - a ninja and a green sumo warrior named Yamo. You can defeat them by punching, kicking, dropping on their heads or luring them into hazardous terrain, or even by making them accidentally hit each other. Even after they are killed, however, they keep coming back for more after a few seconds. Since they can move pretty intelligently (they even climb ladders), you should watch out for them. 

There are lots of hazards to avoid by either walking round or jumping - walls of electrical charge and exploding bushes for example.

        <desc>Bubble Bobble is the story of two humans, Bub and Bob who wander into the mysterious cave of monsters and magically turn into dinosaurs. The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave...

Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.

The player has a realistic range of moves and must use them wisely, as Ki (life-force) is drained for every move made, whether successful or not, and both this and your stamina level must be kept high.

You can practice your skills alone, or spar against the instructors or your friends. Finally, when you feel you are ready, you can travel to the martial arts world championship tournament at Budokan.

The main difference, is that in this case, the turret of our vehicle, can fly and shoot in the air at the enemies.

        <desc>A computer game version of a famed TV quiz show based around the game of darts. The computer version features 2 players, both human-controlled - on TV there were 3 teams of 2 (one amateur darts player and one to answer questions)

The first round uses a custom board which is split both inwards (4 separate grades representing 30,50,100 and 200 points respectively) and around (10 sections lettered A-K, representing a different subject each). The first player must choose a category to aim at, and shoot a dart at it. If they hit one of the sections for that letter, they get that score and are asked the question. If they hit another category they get no bonus but are asked that question - if it's still there. Each players gets 3 goes at this, with increasingly tough questions worth 30,50,100 points.

Round 2 involves each player throwing 3 darts at a standard board, with the player who scores the most getting asked a question, with the value of the darts on offer. If they get it wrong, the other player gets a chance, for the points THEY scored. This is repeated 3 times.

After these 2 rounds, the player who is in front gets to aim at a board with 8 black segments, 8 red ones and the bullseye. The bully scores 50 points, the others reds score a randomly-selected value between 15 and 45, the blacks score zero, and hitting a red for the second time loses you that prize - hence the presenter's catchphrase "keep out of the black and into the red, nothing in this game for 2 in a bed".

Once the player has finished the round, they choose whether to gamble their score against the final Prize Board. 101 points must be scored in 4 darts (in the TV show it was 6 - 3 for each player)

        <name>Cabal (128K)</name>
        <desc>Cabal is a coin-op conversion of Capcom's arcade game. The mechanics of the game are simple: shoot everything in sight!

The hero (there is a two player mode) runs back and forth along the bottom of the screen, ducking and dodging bullets and grenades from the enemy. The roll maneuver from the arcade was not implemented in the PC version. You return fire by moving a target around the screen which also moves your character, so be careful not to run into a bullet.

The enemies throughout the 5 levels, come thick and fast and there are loads of them, normal foot soldiers, tanks, helicopters and end of level bosses, like submarines and war machines.

Just about everything on the screen can be blown up or shot. There are bonus points to be picked up for destroying buildings and weapons to be picked up from the enemy, such as machine- and shot-guns.

Players can select sponsors (absent in some versions) and compete in events such as skateboarding, footbag, surfing, roller skating, flying disc (frisbee) and BMX.  The surfing event is ranked by judges, which give a score to help the players improve their routine.

The Atari versions (2600 and Lynx) of the game omit the flying disc and roller skating events, while the Genesis version omits only the flying disc event.

The alien High Command's base has been found on a small planetoid full of dangerous canyons. Find the mothership there and blow it to bits in this vertical scrolling shoot-em-up. 

The game consists of 4 heavily defended canyons (turrets, spaceships, missiles etc.), and each canyon has a big guard alien at the end. Various pickup items exist for extra weapons, shields and fuel - running out of fuel loses the game immediately. At the end of each canyon level you briefly re-dock with your supply ship and receive extra fuel and shields. The game also includes a map editor, but that deliberately limits you to editing the first 3 levels. Levels can be saved/loaded via tape. AY/FM music is supported on 128K Spectrum models.

        <desc>"El Capitán Trueno" (Captain Thunder) is the name of a famous Spanish comic book which tells the ongoing story of the eponymous 12th-century hero.  This is the first game dealing with the character, released to all of the Spanish-speaking world's most vital computing platforms at the time: ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX and MS-DOS; all  ports except for the PC version contain two different segments, the first a calmer adventure portion followed by some frenetic arcade action.

The final mission is to rescue Sigrid, Trueno's beloved, from the monastery of his friend Abbot Estanislao de Castiglione. Along the way, the Capitán will have to face giant spiders, skeleton soldiers, enormous rats and a plethora of imaginative creatures such as the Abbot transformed into a demonic goat. The Capitán strives to triumph over all these opponents with the assistance of his friends sturdy Goliath, who though immobile can lash out with meaty fists and jump in place to cause earthquakes, and nimble Crispín, a man who can shimmy up a rope of any length.

        <desc>Your task is to infiltrate Megalomann's desert headquarters, the Doom Tube. This consists of three cylinders, one inside the other, each divided into several decks (levels) which are subdivided into quadrants (rooms). They are interconnected by an elevator, the Orbivator.
The virus has, however, leaked into some of the rooms - some are more poisonous than others - and through the Captain has been injected with a protective serum, if a quadrant is too toxic it will kill him. The serum that keeps him alive is only temporarily effective but the ingredients to make more can be produced in the Converter quadrant.
The Converter is activated by touching certain wall panels and placing sufficient quantities of Ying and Yang (the ingredients) in receiver plates. Ying and Yang can be obtained by blasting a doom pod found in one of the quadrants.
You carry a nearly indestructible shield to deflect projectiles and nearly all energy beams. In some rooms, however, rotators are active and send out lethal beams. On destruction these rotators release a codeword which can be helpful in accessing later areas of the Doom Tube.
If you can reach the final deck of the Doom Tube, you may be able to disarm the missile - but the game is played in real time, and you are given just one hour to save the world.

Gameplay is platform-based, with 12 vertically-scrolling levels, each containing around 50 diamonds - the more of these you can collect, the higher your score. Some will require advance planning to reach, while you will often be dependent on booster pads to reach the higher sections of a level.

His three foes in this game are Sly Sludge (who is trying to turn earth into a perma-sunny holiday resort, by using excess CFCs to destroy the ozone layer), Looten Plunder (who has kidnapped dolphins for experimentation) and Doctor Blight (who is destroying the rainforests).

Controlling Captain Planet himself, you start off by flying into the screen, collecting time bonus and avoiding hitting stars. Once you've hit one, the main shoot 'em up body of the game starts. The Captain runs and flies, while firing a fusion of fire, water and air. He must stop those enemies of mankind by destroying their rockets, barrels of poison and their minions. Each level ends by facing them as bosses.

        <desc>Carrier Command was one of the first real-time strategy games.

You control an advanced cybernetic aircraft carrier complete with fighters, amphibious assault vehicles, laser defenses and a fleet of decoy drones.  Your mission is to build a series of resource, factory, and defensive bases spanning an island chain.  The only problem?  At the other end of the chain is an even more advanced carrier under control of a terrorist organization with the same mission.

As you move around the islands you must decide what facilities to build and where they will best support your advance.  Resource islands provide materials that factory islands can use to build weapons and vehicles to replace your combat losses but both will be quickly overrun if the enemy attacks them while you are not present.  You also have to ensure that your stockpiles of equipment are stored safely until you can find time to launch a resupply drone to bring them to your carrier.

From your carrier, you can take first person control of your attack aircraft and amphibious tanks and use them to assault enemy islands or even the enemy carrier itself if you're lucky enough to find it.  The weapon payloads on your vehicles are completely configurable based on your needs.  An island invasion may require launching a virus bomb that will take over the enemy command systems or just blasting the base with a wire guided surface to surface missile.

Ultimately, you have to find and destroy the enemy carrier but, doing so will require a solid supply infrastructure and a strategy for depriving your opponent of his.

        <desc>As famous seducer of XVIII century, Giacomo Casanova, you are walking on the streets of some town full of obsessed women and jealous men. Using your mandolin you should clean your way of the town inhabitants shooting the music notes at them. The amount of notes are limited as well as the amount of life and the amount of your life energy, which may be reduced by items thrown at you by town inhabitants. Lovely doves may increase your energy feeding you with eggs, which they drop during flying. Also you may climb the static chains and the ropes emerging from the magic pots, jump, and collect the brassieres increasing your score. Every contact with town inhabitant will take one of your lives out and return you to the starting position of your perilous adventure.

        <name>Castle Master (48K)</name>
        <desc>Castle Master is the fourth and final individual game to use the Freescape first-person solid 3D game system (after Driller, Dark Side and Total Eclipse). As a Prince or Princess armed with a slingshot, you have to explore a medieval castle to free your beloved from the evil Magister. 

Gameplay combines action and puzzle-solving, across four primary towers with three levels each. Doors must be opened using one of the ten included keys. These are unmarked, as are the various potions - making it a challenge to know which keys open which doors, and which potions are beneficial. 

Contact with ghouls drains your energy, as does falling too far (there are narrow pathways to negotiate), while eating cheese can replenish this. Movement and aiming are controlled separately.

        <desc>Playing a witch, you must assemble the six ingredients required to kill off your arch-rival, an evil pumpkin. The ingredients are all located in underground buildings, each of which can only be entered once you've found the appropriate key. The keys are located overground, and you must fly around on your broom to collect them.

The overground sections play like standard shoot 'em ups, as your broom is not affected by gravity and can fire bullets using your magic energy. Bats, fireballs and even seagulls are among the many creatures trying to stop you - contact will cost you more energy than shooting at them would. There are energy recharges on offer.

Once you go underground, the gameplay becomes a test of precision platform jumping, including some Manic Miner-esque blind jumps. The six underground sections can be completed in a variety of orders, but you will sometimes reach points that cna't be completed without objects from other sections, so a lot of back-tracking is required. Although you start with nine lives, they won't last all that long at first.

        <name>Cauldron II - The Pumpkin Strikes Back (48K)</name>
        <desc>An evil witch has brought evil and darkness to the enchanted wood, wiping out all but 1 of the innocent pumpkins. As the poem in the instructions sheet explains, the only way to put things right is to capture a lock of her hair, then take it to the cauldron and cast a spell to undo things.

Controlling the pumpkin is difficult at first, as it has a very high bounce, the exact level of which can be toggled using the 5 key. Direction can only be changed when the ball is on the ground. Ricocheting into enemies costs energy, and you only gain weaponry by landing into magic pools. The starting positions are random,  making mapping advisable and increasing the initial challenge.

Even then, enemies respawn quickly, so all you're doing is buying a little time to pass them. Others can't be shot, and must be passed by possessing the right object - possibly one of the 5 you will ultimately need to vanquish the witch.

They have decided to infiltrate a nuclear power station and programmed the robots to empty the containment vault and attack all scientists inside it. To make matters worse, the entire facility will self-destruct in fifty minutes. 

As one of the scientists that survived the onslaught, the player must prevent this from happening by collecting eighteen fuel canisters scattered around all seven floors of the facility and disposing of them in the pit that lies at the center of the first floor, but only one canister can be carried at a time. 

If the player comes into contact with any of the robots, their radiation level increases. Once the player becomes totally contaminated, they will die. There are decontamination showers around the facility, and entering them reduces their radiation level. 

Players are also equipped with a jet-pack that can be used to fly over dangerous areas.

        <name>Chase H.Q. II - Special Criminal Investigations (128K)</name>
        <desc>Three girls have been reported missing including the mayor's daughter, and Chase Special Investigations has asked you to track down five vehicles, mentioned in the mission briefing, who are believed to be involved in the kidnapping. Using a heavy-designed machine with a V6 DOHC 3000CC Twin Turbo Engine, five sets of nitro-fuel boosts, and a gun attached to the steering wheel (which you can use to damage the target vehicle), your mission is to patrol the streets and find these vehicles.

The gameplay is similar to Chase H.Q., but there are a few differences. For example, cars travel in both directions instead of one, and some of them will catch up to your car and shoot at you. At least once in every stage a helicopter does a fly by and drops you some grenades you can use to further damage the target vehicle. A guy on a motorcycle will catch up to you and throw grenades at your car. And, most importantly, as mentioned earlier, you can shoot at the target vehicle rather than just bumping into it.

Have fun driving around, but remember, there is a strict time limit, so I wouldn't waste time or keep crashing into things if I were you.

        <desc>Three different cars are on offer in this early racing game – The McFaster Special, The Psion Pegasus and the Ferretti Turbo. There are ten racetracks, including classics such as Silverstone, Monaco and Monza. There are no computerised opponents in the game, but the tracks are full of hazards such as lakes, glass hazards and oil slicks, as well as the danger of crashing, or over-revving your engine. The controls include two keys for steering in each direction, with one steering the car more rapidly, in an attempt to recreate analogue control on digital equipment. The ultimate challenge is to beat the lap record for each track.

        <desc>You are Eliot, on the trail of the gangsters who dominate Chicago in the 1930s. They lurk in the docks, on the streets and in an alcohol distillery, armed with guns and grenades, and must be taken out. 

Gameplay is side-view and takes place on a number of vertical levels, with a feel similar to Green Beret. Jump and duck to target and avoid crooks. Later you spend time inside a car, and can lean out of the window to shoot people. Watch out for enemy cars, which can only be destroyed using grenades.

        <desc>Chichén Itzá is a Spanish text-adventure, the final "book" of the "Ci-U-Than" trilogy of games. They all utilize the parser DAAD, that has capabilities similar to the Infocom Z-machine one (you can chain commands, correct misspellings, etc). This time the main quest is divided in two parts: In the first half you have to satisfy all the gods demands while exploring the ruined temple and solving its mystery. In the last part you journey from hell to heaven in an effort to liberate the god Kukulkán from his prison.
This was the last game of Aventuras AD, and had the misfortune of being released alongside the Monkey Island games. It was considered antiquated for its time, and was partially ignored by the public.

To complete each screen you must collect the five blue crosses. Once you reach the mansion and find her, you must escort your girlfriend back through the same territories, switching between characters to collect the blue (him) and red (her) crosses as quickly as you can, still not safe.

        <desc>He raised from the Hell and sighed. On his face the wrath of a demon and the ambition of thousand devils. He sprouted like a bad seed in the temple of Shaolin, whose walls lodged the best fighters of all times. The destiny has decided that the last hour for the good has arrived, because the yellow devil seized the original manuscript where Cheng Heung wrote the art of the Choy Lee Fut.

Supported on the force of the five magical animals, the speed and the technique of a good apprentice, we will cross the temple of Shaolin until finding the monster and recovering the scroll. We are expert in punches, we handle the sabre with ferocity and make the flexible lance more penetrating and versatile. And all thanks to the Chi. As first action, we will have the possibility of training with the Dummies (the wood men), where we will practice the distance, the speed and the use of complementary techniques. From which we will get up ourselves into the dynamics of the fight and the confrontations hand-to-hand with the partisans of the evildoer.

The movements are varied, all of them based on the Fung-Fu techniques. With different arms we will be able to execute different movements using the same keys. Everything depends on the animal that our personage will adopt. The graphical theme also changes according to the fight scenes, including the face of the old man that observes us.

        <desc>This shoot 'em up resembles many others, but was released at budget price. You're in control of space craft Chronos, which must get way out of the Mystical Dimension it has been trapped in. This means zapping through six constantly-scrolling and diverse levels of minions including balls, ships and spinning dice. The level designs are such that many sections of barriers and force fields need to be shot before you get to them. Lots of immovable blockades and blind tunnels are in place, so the route is extremely mazy. Bonus tokens can be picked up in a sequence which grows in value progressively, so be careful to pick up the earlier ones and keep the sequence going.

        <desc>In the game you play Hen House Harry who has to collect 12 (a dozen) eggs from each level, while avoiding the ducklings.  The levels each occupy a single screen, and are made up of platforms, ladders and lifts (or elevators), and are thus similar to those in classic platform game Donkey Kong.  Corn can also be collected, which stops the time limit from ticking down and also stops the bonus, collected when the level is completed, from decreasing.  The ducklings also eat the corn, however.

There are only 8 distinct levels.  The ninth level is a copy of level 1, the tenth is a copy of level 2, and so on.  However, on the second time around the ducklings that can use the platforms and ladders are replaced by the Mother Duck, who can fly around the level going through the platforms and ladders.  On the third time around, you have to face both the Mother Duck and the ducklings, and similarly on subsequent goes round, when there are more ducklings.

        <desc>Chuckie Egg II is a sequel to platformer game Chuckie Egg, but is very different from the original game.  Whereas the original game features eight levels of one screen each, this features many more screens arranged into a maze for you to explore.

In the game, Hen House Harry must build a giant chocolate egg, with the ingredients (cocoa, milk and sugar), that are found in the factory.  Eight of each must be included.  Also, the eight parts of a toy kit must be found, to place inside the egg.

In order to get all the items you must find your way around the factory, avoiding many types of enemy, and solving puzzles using various items that you can carry.  There are a number of ways to get around the factory, including the platforms of the original, but also ropes and pipes, among other things.

Despite the drastic changes from the original, the game still retains the sound effects from the original.

The game is a standard platform title, in which you can shoot peanuts at your enemies, or use bombs you collect.

You start with 9 lives, which sounds generous, but the levels are full of spikes and bad guys which can come to get you at any point. The enemies include policemen, Indians, dogs and burly American footballers (quite a stereotypical view of Americans there). Each level has a guardian at the end.

You start with nine lives, but the game's design is such that a lot of deaths will be unexpected, so prior knowledge of the layouts is essential to get through most sections of the five levels without losing lives. The two-player mode involves the screen following the lead player, so the latter can lose lives by getting too far behind. With lots of precise jumps across vertically-progressing ledges involved, a lot of skill and timing is required.

        <desc>Cobra's Arc is a curious conversational adventure in which the messages the computer send us play a fundamental role, but instead of replying to them directly, we must choose the action to do by pointing to the available icons of the actions menu, therefore this is what could be called an iconographic adventure. Also, you will find lots of places, personages and situations through the game, all of them surrounded in an atmosphere of fantasy and legend, so the action could take place in deserts, as well as inhospitable mountain ranges or mysterious walled cities.

The plot of the game turns around a fabulous treasure, an immense amount of accumulated wealth during centuries by the priests of an old culture dedicated to the adoration of the god Cobra. According to the tradition, the temple where the priests jealously kept their jewels, diamonds and objects made with the most precious metals, was constructed on a ship, reason why it resisted the great deluge.
Now the fortune hunters have as obsession finding at all costs the palace of the god Cobra. But for it, they will have to fulfill two objectives: killing the prince Cobra and the wizard; once they do it, they will be ready to find so incredible treasure.

        <desc>Benurio, a merchant's son, has fallen foul of the wicked Nerio, chief of the Emperor's Praetorian Guard. Both men are trying to win the affection of the beautiful Calia - but the unscrupulous Nerio has denounced Benurio and forced him to race in the Circus Maximus. However, chariot racing is a rough business and the other participants will try to kill you before the end of the race...

You must complete four hazardous races in each of which you'll have to complete four laps, avoiding the obstacles and fighting off your opponents. They will carry weapons of increasing deadliness with which they'll try to reduce your energy, these could be hatchets (the basic weapon), but also swords, mallets, tridents, nets or lances. You can obtain anyone of them when beating its carrier.

        <desc>In the year 2046, the Industry of Intelligent Androids (MOXAT) has created the DERGON system, a revolutionary artificial intelligence standard based on human thoughts.

Contrary to what was expected, the new system is going to be a catastrophe for mankind: those intelligent machines spread throughout the entire confederation of planets XATOR sowing death and desolation.

The only way to stop them is to destroy the planets in which they are located. With this purpose, MOXAT has been placing high-powered explosive charges for more than two years in the affected planets, and now it is time for you to detonate them.

"Comando Tracer" is an arcade game in which we control a spaceship that is able to wear weapons and ionic piles, which we will need to detonate the explosives of each planet, before we arrive to the transport platform in order to go to the next planet/level.

Extra grenades can be collected, and will definitely be required, as they allow you to kill form distance and thus avoid some enemy shots.

        <desc>This is a puzzle game where you must explode all of the bombs on each level, using a spark.  The spark flows along a fuse, which is made up of a series of tiles.  These can be moved, in the manner of sliding puzzles, where there is only one gap, and tiles can be moved into the gap, creating a new gap.  The aim is then to move the tiles so the fuse forms a path from the spark to each bomb. 

There is a time limit, however, and extra time is knocked off if the spark reaches a dead end.  Also some levels contain water droplets, that extinguish the spark if they touch it.

        <desc>It's Whodunit time in this licensed arcade adventure starring Sam Cruise. As Sam you must collect the clues by walking over them, with the hope of finding the killer. Money is an issue as well, as more can be collected, but it will be needed as the game goes on.

The city is awash with Gangsters, and neither they nor the police are happy with your methods or motives. Gangster bullets should be avoided if possible, as you only have the medical kits to repair the damage from 8 shots - fortunately a plethora of evasive moves are offered including rolls and somersaults. The police can be evaded by wearing disguises.

Many buildings can be entered and explored for clues, but leaving the lights on can alert people to your presence. Telephone calls play a big part in the game - initially you only have the number for your office, but this is a potential goldmine of clues, and more numbers can be obtained in a manner similar to Hacker.

The first race is in Brazil and features 100 cars, and requires you to finish in the top 80 in order to qualify for  next race. As you work through the 8 races the size of the field steadily decreases, but so does the worst acceptable finishing position to qualify.

The car has high and low gears, and is susceptible to damage from contact with another car. Once you hit a car or a piece of the trackside scenery you will be called into the pits - fail to make it back, or hit another car, and you will crash and lose several seconds.

        <name>Corsarios (Part 1 of 2) (128K)</name>
        <desc>As the name indicates, Corsarios is a game focused on sea affairs, which consists of two independent parts. On the first one, you will be on a wild island, a place in which we will have to face endless hordes of pirates whose only obsession will be killing us. Some of them will use all kind of deadly weapons, such as the famous saber or a blunderbuss. Luckily for us and unfortunately for them, our protagonist is quite capable when it comes to fight with punches and kicks. So if all goes well, you will find a small boat which is awaiting you at the other extreme of the island.

The second part, to which we can access without the need of finishing the first one, takes place in a pirate galleon. There we will have to represent the role of the hero once again and we should try to rescue the beautiful damsel. Now the game system is quite different from the first part, because we will be no longer able to directly blow our enemies, but we will have to use a sword to finish with all of them. The objective consists in ascending to the pirate flags which are in the different masts of the ship and, in the end, to arrive where the girl is before she ends being food for sharks.

The Rygellian Slime Beasts know that their enemies the Cosmic Wartoads believe that there isn't, and as such knew that turning their queen into one was the worst thing they could do. Fortunately there is a Wartoad heroic enough to seek revenge, and that is you.

The player has 90 minutes to complete the game, in which time you must cross an 8x8 grid (from top right to bottom left, moving one space at a time) whose squares have a variety of functions. The action meat of the game involves shooting out the slime fired off by the Rygellian occupants of each square, which must be destroyed for the player to take possession of any square. The player has three lives for this.

Other squares contain enhanced weapons, and the keys which are required to pass blockaded areas

Duckula though, thinks the motion of the turret is a side effect of drinking Nanny's potion (understandable really), but he soon realises their true predicament when they hit an asteroid field. Fortunately Tremendous Terence, Count Duckula's hero, comes to the rescue, knocking their 'turret spacecraft' on to a nearby planet surface. Oh dear though it's the planet Cute! - Yuk! Duckula hates cute things, and he soon realises that if he and his pals stay on this planet for any length of time, they too will become...Cute...aagghh!! All the cuties dollies and teddybears want to give our pal a big kiss (Blah!) to speed up the cuteness process. There's only one thing for it Duckula, Igor and Nanny have got to get off this planet and quick, but they have lost the lightning conductor in the crash landing and they will need this to escape. Can Tremendous Terence help, will they get away, it's up to you.</desc>

        <desc>The game starts when you first enter the main control module of Cray-5.

Once there, you should disconnect the host, and go to the escape pod to return to the main hall.

For safety reasons, the Cray-5 control module is separated from the rest of the ship, cannot be accessed from it, and, moreover, is segmented into 9 watertight levels.

To disconnect the host computer, you should turn off each and every one of the switches scattered in nine zones. In each area you will find a teleporter that may carry you to a variable number of other areas, depending on how many switches you have turned off.

        <desc>Starting Titus' racing series of third-person perspective racing games, Crazy Cars encompasses the American Cross Country Prestige Cars Race. This takes in several parts of the USA, in several powerful cars. Initially you have a Porsche 911 Turbo in your hands, but this can later be upgraded to a Lamborghini and then a Ferrari. There are other cars on the road, which you must avoid contact with. Bumps and divots in the road throws the car off course, as does contact with any of the roadside barriers. Each race must be completed within the time limit.

        <desc>The follow-up to Cybernoid: The Fighting Machine is again a flip-screen shoot 'em up. In control of the deadly Cybernoid craft, your job is to rescue the cargo which has been stolen by a wave of pirate ships.

Using the range of weapon systems correctly is again a key factor. These include sideways aiming guns, bouncing bombs, 'seeker' smart bombs, bombs which move around th edge of the screen before finding a target, and time-sensitive bombs which explode a few seconds after you drop them. Shot pirate ships release cargo, and you must collect at least 1500 points of this, but on many screens it is more prudent to make an escape ASAP, as some screens have more hazards than others, and not all aliens on each screen act in the same way.

        <name>Dalek Attack - Doctor Who (Trainer) (128K)</name>
        <desc>It's the year 2254 and earth has been invaded by the most ruthless and vicious race in the universe The DALEKS.
Under instruction from their leader, the evil Davros,  they have captured four major cities, LONDON, PARIS, NEW YORK and TOKYO.
Each city has been sealed off using a dome force field, and the DALEKS have constructed huge ozone destroying machines, which have been carefully located in each of the cities.
To ensure success the DALEKS have not come alone. They have brought with them their henchmen the OGRONS (war loving ape like creatures, who obey their every command), also vile MUTANTS who have developed a taste for Earthlings, DINOSAURS who have been cloned and programmed to attack humans, and of course a range of their huge ROBOT SUPER GUARDIANS armed with the very latest weaponery.
The TIMELORDS have summoned the 'DOCTOR' to help the humans combat this terror and save the Universe from the evil of the DALEKS.</desc>

Ten events were featured, including long and high jumps as well as the predictable sprints, which made for some gameplay variety.

For each event you see both the qualifying time and the world record, which gives you something to aim at.

        <name>Daley Thompson's Olympic Challenge (128K)</name>
        <desc>The third licensed game based around the legendary British decathlete did something slightly wider in scope than the basic Games style of play. Before you play the main events you have to train in the gym. Weight-lifting, squats and sit-ups are included, which involve waggling the joystick as fast as you can to fill a displayed bottle of Lucozade (clever bit of product-placement there). The better you do at this, the better you'll fare in the events, which are predominantly waggling-based as well. They include the standard decathlon events of running, jumping and throwing as well as you can. There are four types of shoes available, and choosing the wrong one for the event will seriously hamper your performance.

        <name>Daley Thompson's Super-Test (128K)</name>
        <desc>Ten sporting events (twelve on the 128K Spectrum version) are recreated in the second game licensed around the Decathlon champion. Each one has its own world record, and a target time / distance / score to reach - fail and you lose one of your three lives. After completing all events successfully they repeat with tougher targets.

Rowing, 100m and cycling are pure tests of joystick waggling, and this is a feature of may other events. The penalty shoot-out involves timing the run-up then pressing fire to set the angle of the shot. In the ski-jump, timing the launch and landing are crucial. The tug of war involves choosing a candidate you feel you can beat and then out-waggling them.

In the triple jump you must run to the line before holding down fire for the right length of time for each of the 3 phases of the jump (45 degrees is optimal). The hurdles event involves running to and pressing fire to clear the hurdles. 

Pistol shooting gives you limited time to correctly move a sight into position, before firing as close to the centre as possible. This is made harder by only being able to move up and towards the target, which prevents being able to correct over-movement.

        <desc>A licensed game based around the cult comic strip character, recreating his daring attempts to defeat Mekon and save the earth.

The Anastasia ship is attacked by the Treens as soon as Dan steps onto it, although fortunately he picks up a laser on board. From then on, he must act as fast as possible.

The main task is to find each of the 5 parts of a planetary-destruction mechanism to the control room, so that it can be safely diffused. He can only carry one at a time, and once he gets the back he must find the correct socket for each one. Lastly he must escape to the surface.

Contact with a Treen will see Dan kidnapped and placed in the prison area; he can get out easily enough, but will now be in a different place. Getting hit by gun blasts will weaken him gradually.

        <desc>In the third game in the Dan Dare series, Dan has been kidnapped by an evil alien race known as the Treens and taken to their scientific satellite orbiting Venus, but it doesn't take long for Dan to break free and goes down into their ship. While searching it, he eventually finds an escape shuttle sitting in the launch bay, only to discover that it is out of fuel. He returns to the satellite in an attempt to find some.

The fuel cans are scattered around the five levels of the ship, which Dan can get to by using the Mekon's teleporters. To get to them though, Dan needs to destroy any Treen that gets in his way using a variety of weapons, brought by using a computer terminal. Along the way, the Mekon leader can be seen sitting around, and destroying him will more often than not reward Dan with a pod that he needs to access the teleporter. Dan can use his jet-pack to navigate the satellite, but this will eventually run out of fuel.

        <name>Darius+ (128K)</name>
        <desc>Darius was Taito's effort to compete in the arcades against the likes of R-Type and Gradius. Technically impressive, it featured three screens depicting the largest playfield seen in a game so far (the same system was employed for Ninja Warriors), with the player sitting atop a big set of loudspeakers. Visually and audibly, it was a league above Irem's and Konami's offerings.

When Taito (and others) ported the game to home machines, they were forced to shrink the playfield to fit in one single screen, and re-dubbed it Darius Plus.

The plot of Darius involves the two heroes Proco Jr. and Tiat Young fighting the menaces posed by galactic fish and other sea animals again their homeworld.

What sets Darius apart from other shoot'em-ups of the time is its way of letting the player choose his path with a certain amount of freedom. At the end of each area (level), you are able to choose between one of two worlds which the area branches into. This renders a higher replay value, since there are many paths to reach the end of the game by.
Apart from this, the gameplay is on the simplistic side, both due to unimaginative attack waves and little interaction with the surroundings, but mainly due to the very basic powerup system, which is nowhere near the complexity of the aforementioned R-Type's and Gradius'.

The 'Dark Fusion' of the title refers to a game element where, after completing part of the game the player, who is a member of the elite Corps of Guardian Warriors, must choose whether to fuse themselves with there vanquished foe or continue with only their mortal powers.

There are four levels in the game and each level is divided into three zones - Combat zone, Alien zone, and the Flight zone. In the Combat zone the player starts out as a warrior in a space suit. Scrolling to the right there are numerous aliens that have to be shot / bypassed in order to reach the end of the level. Some aliens as they perish leave behind power ups which are essential to progressing through the game.

The player must enter and kill all the aliens in two Alien Zones in order to complete the Combat zone, then they must fight their way to the Flight Zone fusion pod to become a space ship and fly through to the next level.</desc>

        <desc>Billed as the fastest vector graphics ever seen on the Spectrum up to that point, and with full colour to boot, Dark Star has similarities with the Star Wars arcade game. Viewed from your cockpit, you fly the LIAR spacecraft around the galaxy, with the hope of achieving liberation, by destroying all the Evil Lord's main bases.

You'll have to fly accurately through hyperspace tunnels, and keep moving so as to avoid enemy fire, ideally destroying enemy spaceports as well as planetary bases. There are plenty of energy dumps along the way, which you'll need to collect in order to be able to reach all 256 sectors.

The game is hugely customizable, with almost all controls redefinable, and the speed and power of the enemy variable.

        <desc>Bearded inventor Sir Clive Sinclair was so respected by users of his computer system that he even starred in this game. 

As the title suggests, the game involves navigating Clive past a series of mundane tasks. To give you a clue, the first level involves getting out of bed, getting a suit from a cupboard (dodging a TV, a Spectrum and a cat in doing so), then going upstairs to collect a key (dodging what appears to be an alien), then going back downstairs through the door. Unusually, all points are assessed and awarded after the level is completed.

        <desc>Tom Cruise's film brought NASCAR racing to the masses, and Mindscape did the same for games players with this license. If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of real NASCAR racing rather than a direct recreation of the film. 

You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied.  This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves.

From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you loose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit.

The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.

        <desc>Deep Strike is set in World War 2, and you form part of a squadron attempting a dangerous mission of destroying a Nazi fuel depot. Your fighter plane is armed with guns; a team of bombers are out there with you, with one always in front.

Initially you will face a few planes flying towards you. red planes shoot at you, and later there are black 'suicide planes' which aim to take you down Kamikaze style, and 'Blue Max' planes which are extra-tough.

After the first minute or so another challenge is added, in the shape of hills to fly around or over. After this, you reach the bombing zone, in which you guide the bombers behind you and instruct them which sites to bomb.

The game is viewed from the cockpit, with displays telling you of how much damage you and the bomber have taken, and whether you are steering in the right direction. A map is build in. The controls can be set in two ways, for 'up' on the joystick either equaling 'move upwards' or 'dive' (as on a real plane).

        <desc>There's plenty of reflection in this game, in both senses of the word. That's because this strategic puzzler involves using mirrors to direct a beam of light across a succession of 60 screens. Each mirror has 16 different angles it can be set at, each of which will send the beam around the screen in different ways.

Before the exit is activated, all the mines on a screen must be cleared by running the beam over them. There are other devices built into the levels, including teleports and random angle-changers, as well as hazards to avoid (they cause the beam to overheat) and droids which go around moving the mirrors' directions.

        <name>Delta Charge! (128K)</name>
        <desc>Delta is a horizontally scrolling shooter computer game originally released for the Commodore 64 by Thalamus Ltd in 1987. It was programmed by Stavros Fasoulas and the music was written by Rob Hubbard. The menu-music is based on the theme of Koyaanisqatsi by Philip Glass and the in-game-music is based on Pink Floyd's On the Run. The game was also released for the ZX Spectrum in 1990 as Delta Charge.

The game was released as Delta Patrol in the United States by Electronic Arts for its Amazing Software line of action-oriented software programs, in 1987 on the Commodore 64.[1]

The player controls a spaceship and gains power-up points by destroying formations of enemies. Some enemy formations instead subtract power-up points for the player, so the player must take note of which formations to destroy. Periodically blocks containing the power-ups (higher speed, faster rate of fire) appear and the player can pick one of them up: The more points the player has collected, the more powerful are the power-ups that can be chosen. Unavailable power-ups are gray and kill the player if he flies into them, making them part of the obstacles in the game. The effects of the power-ups are lost over time and must therefore be regained. The player gets a choice between in-game music or in-game sound effects. There is also a high score table but no way to save it when the game is turned off.

The game title music was covered by Desert Planet in their 2003 album Joystick Pop.</desc>

        <desc>Gun.Smoke is a top-down scrolling shooter that casts the gamer as a lone gunman, out to save the gold rush town of Hicksville from a fearsome group of bandits known as the Wingates. Each level has a particular target enemy, although his or her henchmen must also be taken out.

Although it largely takes place on foot, the gameplay resembles Commando, with its top-down action. The screen scrolls at a constant rate, and enemies come at you from the edges, to be shot or avoided. You can grab various power-ups along the way. Finding a horse will allow you to get hit twice before you die rather than just once. There are scenes in which you raft up a river and use the tracks of a railway line.

On the NES you can tap the A button to fire up and right, the B button to fire up and left, or A and B simultaneously to fire straight ahead. One-button control systems mimic all this.

        <desc>The scene chosen for this adventure, the first one of the "Ci-U-Than" trilogy, is the Yucatan, a mysterious land in which legends say there are a lot of dangers, hidden treasures, unsolved mysteries, temples filled with traps... in short, the ingredients to which the good adventurer is used to deal with.

The adventure is developed in the island of Cozumel, where you must guide an archaeologist who had an incident. He was sailing towards it perfectly equipped, when an unfortunate shipwreck left him without anything. Do not think he only lost the map or the machete, no, he lost everything, including the trousers and the underclothes, reason why it's quite possible that an entrance in San Marcos, coastal town near the place of the shipwreck, would carry serious problems with the justice. The main mission of the adventure is to discover all the hidden secrets of the island and then be able to escape from it.

This game uses the habitual commands of the previous AD adventures, plus the inclusion of some PSI characters, it means, personages with own personality, decision capacity, different behavior according to the development of the adventure, that is, personages who must be treated as if they were real since their reactions can vary from a game to another. Some improvements like the objects treatment system have been incorporated (which include all their qualities); a better graphical detail; a score system that it indicates you which actions are positive and which negative, etc.

        <desc>Dizzy's world is being harassed by the evil wizard Zaks! You play as Dizzy, the anthropomorphic egg, and you must search the land for a Leprechaun's Wig, a Cloud's Silver Lining, a Vampire Dux Feather, and Troll Brew, to make a potion to defeat Zaks with.

This is the first game in a long line of platform/adventure games starring Dizzy. In this game, like all Dizzy adventure games, gameplay is standard platformer fare, except there inventory items scattered around the world, which are necessary to overcome obstacles and progress through the game. The world expands in all four compass directions, items are frequently far away from the obstacles they are used on, and you can only hold one item in your inventory at a time (later games gave you more baggage space), so much backtracking is necessary!

One thing unique about the first Dizzy game is that there are MANY more monsters and hazards in this one than in later Dizzys. Also unique is that some inventory items are used to destroy monsters. For example, one of the first inventory items you find is birdseed. As long as birdseed is the item in your inventory, you destroy any birds you touch. But this made it necessary to juggle items excessively often, so the concept was dropped from the sequels in favor of more inventory-based puzzles.

        <name>Dizzy V - Spellbound Dizzy (128K)</name>
        <desc>Spellbound Dizzy is a continuation of the adventures of the egg and his friends, this time containing over 100 screens with individual names. Dizzy has trapped himself in a strange world whilst experimenting with a spell book, and must find his way out. Gameplay is mostly similar to the previous games, combining puzzle-solving and object manipulation with arcade-style jumps and hazard-dodging. Lateral thinking is required to decipher the riddles found on scrolls. There are also extra arcade sections on a runaway mine-cart and for a spot of scuba-diving.

        <desc>Dominator is a classic shooter game. You're in control of a small spaceship and have once again to save the earth from alien attack. You have to maneuver your craft through small passages while under permanent attack.

The first level is a vertical shooter level with your ship only in its basic configuration.
The later levels are horizontal scrolling and there you get your chance to improve your efficiency by collecting various power up ranging from speed-ups to tail cannons.

Typically, each stage has a final boss who needs a lot of firepower to be beaten.

        <desc>La Mancha, Spain, April of 1605...

You are Don Alonso Quijano, a Manchegan nobleman (hidalgo, more concretely) of the XVI century, whose soft spot is the cavalry novels. Everything goes more or less fine in your house, until one day your madness reaches the culminating point: you decide to take the arms and go out to travel through La Mancha. You obtain a shield-bearer, Sancho Panza, who, although not being the best on the field, will help you in the hardest situations. From this very moment you will be participant of the most incredible adventures you have ever imagined. Winds, hills, forests and inns will be witnesses of your craziest ideas such as attacking mills or challenging fierce lions, but before that, you must equipe yourself like a brave cavalier.

Your final objective, like in the novel, will be to find your beloved and infinitely appreciated, Dulcinea del Toboso.

        <name>Don Quijote de la Mancha - Parte II (Spanish) (48K)</name>
        <desc>La Mancha, Spain, April of 1605...

You are Don Alonso Quijano, a Manchegan nobleman (hidalgo, more concretely) of the XVI century, whose soft spot is the cavalry novels. Everything goes more or less fine in your house, until one day your madness reaches the culminating point: you decide to take the arms and go out to travel through La Mancha. You obtain a shield-bearer, Sancho Panza, who, although not being the best on the field, will help you in the hardest situations. From this very moment you will be participant of the most incredible adventures you have ever imagined. Winds, hills, forests and inns will be witnesses of your craziest ideas such as attacking mills or challenging fierce lions, but before that, you must equipe yourself like a brave cavalier.

Your final objective, like in the novel, will be to find your beloved and infinitely appreciated, Dulcinea del Toboso.

        <name>Donkey Kong (48K)</name>
        <desc>Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.

Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.

Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.

Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.

        <desc>Set in a post-apocalyptic New York, Double Dragon is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers trained in the fighting style of Sou-Setsu-Ken. Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the "Black Warriors", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.

Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.

        <name>Double Dragon II: The Revenge (128K)</name>
        <desc>The lovely Marian was rescued from the clutches of the Black Warriors gang by Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee in the first Double Dragon game, but now the gang has killed her in retaliation of their early defeat. The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.

The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.

The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.

The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an English localization of a "Kunio-kun" game (the Japanese franchise which inspired "Renegade" and "River City Ransom" and has nothing to do with the arcade and NES versions.

        <desc>The final game in the trilogy.

Billy and Jimmy Lee are returning from martial arts training when their paths cross a fortune teller. She tells them of a great evil in Egypt, their strongest adversary yet, and how the Rosetta Stones can aid them.

This game features weapon shops where Billy and Jimmy can buy power-ups, tricks, energy and extra lives to aid them in their quest.

Power-ups make Billy and Jimmy twice their size, increasing their damage done and range of attack.

The character graphics have changed, moving away from cartoon style graphics to more realistic looking characters.</desc>

        <desc>Draconus is an arcade platformer with adventure elements where the player gains control of Frognum - a beast similar to a serpent or a dragon. His mission is to destroy the Tyrant Beast, an evil ruler of the dark and dangerous world in which Frognum lives. The main weapon in the game is fire breath, but on his quest Frognum will find many magical artifacts and, thanks to those, gain new powers. 

The gameplay is simple. The player just has to explore different screens, incinerate opponents and use artifacts (for example Morph Helix that transforms Frognum into a sea monster, which allows him to swim and fight underwater).

        <desc>Zambaquous has done everything to make life hell for the people of Agamen, and as their King Kayus, the time has come to head out to destroy him. This leads to six levels of horizontally-scrolling shoot ‘em up action, although with some vertical movement as well.

The thing which sets the game apart from every other horizontally-scrolling shoot ‘em up (except Saint Dragon) is that you are riding on the back of a dragon, called Bahamoot. Both you and the dragon have firepower, and holding down the fire button increases Bahamoot’s energy bolt’s ferocity. The dragon’s tail can be controlled indirectly, and because it is indestructible, it can be used either as a shield, or as a weapon in its own right. 

There are power-ups to collect by dismounting from the dragon and walking into them. These include fiery breath, bolts shot from Bahamoot’s tail, homing missiles of sorts, and lightning bolts, with only one ever active at a time. Each level has a time limit.

This first port includes two adventures: the first is to raid the lair of Singe the Dragon (hence the classic name) and rescuing Princess Daphne, and the second, in a sort of instant sequel of the first chapter, features Dirk trying to escape from the castle, now overrun by the Lizard King and its minions.

        <name>Druid (48K)</name>
        <desc>Druid is an action game inspired by the arcade hit Gauntlet. As the eponymous hero, your job is to destroy four magic skulls hidden over eight levels. 

The game is presented in a top-down view. The druid walks around the terrain seeking out the staircase that leads to the next level. On the way, he is harassed by hordes of monsters that come out of every direction and attack him, decreasing his health. To defend himself, the druid can use the spells of water, fire or electricity to toss projectiles. However, these magical weapons have limited ammo. 

The druid also has three other magical spells at his disposal - an invisibility spell which prevents the monsters from automatically approaching him, a golem spell which summons a helpful golem (which can be controlled by a second player), and a skull spell which destroys all on-screen enemies. The druid also carries around keys which open locked doors. But all these have very limited supplies. 

On his way, the druid finds many shops. Each such shop contains some keys or charges for the druid's spells, but the druid can only pick one item from each shop. 

The druid can also come across a pentagram on the ground which will restore his lost health.

 blow a safe and steal plans for a secret weapon. For more information,
 press I in the main screen.

The house is divided up into 48 slightly overlapping
 screens, six high, eight wide, but they wrap around horizontally
 which effectively makes the building a cylinder. Along the bottom
 runs a river, which can be negotiated by waiting for a raft to
 float by, jumping down onto it and keeping up with it by walking
 at its speed. Falling into the water is fatal unless you have
 found an oxygen bottle. Other collectable items are the eponymous
 sticks of dynamite (eight are needed to blow open the door of the
 vault), a weapon to defend yourself against the creatures in the
 house, and food to keep up your energy level.</desc>

        <name>Dynamite Dan II - Dr. Blitzen and the Islands of Arcanum (48K)</name>
        <desc>Implanting subliminal messages in music seemingly worked for Judas Priest - the evil Dr. Blitzen is trying to make it work for himself, by planting messages in popular records. Blitzen has used the 8 islands of Arcanium for this task - each contains a jukebox as well as a record containing a clue to the location of the secret factory in which he produces these horrors. Dynamite Dan is back to put a stop to this, by exploring the 8 islands in turn to find the pieces of the puzzle.

There are 192 screens in total - 24 on each island - all loaded with enemies on fixed attack patterns. Some move diagonally, others home in on Dan, and some move horizontally - all of them detract from Dan's energy level, eventually leading to death and failure, and some can steal objects from him. The record and jukebox are randomly placed on each go, as are the enemies. Dan can jump far, and his jumps are bigger if he has taken a run-up.

There are many objects to collect - a torch for theft protection, bomb goggles to blow doors open, foods for restored energy (and a mixer for infinite energy), and dumbells to increase jump size. All of these are used automatically. To escape each island he must also find enough fuel for his trusty Zeppelin.

        <desc>Crime is getting out of control in Liberty City, and to combat the problem, the LCPD establishes a new unit, called ESWAT (Enhanced Special Weapons and Tactics). Police officers who are promoted to this unit wear a cyber-suit that contains state-of-the-art military equipment including two Turbo-Booster Thrusters, extra ammunition, and increased protection. In order to become an ESWAT member, all a dedicated police officer has to do is arrest enough criminal masterminds to progress through the ranks, which include Captain, Assistant Chief, and Chief.

ESWAT: Cyber Police is a horizontal-scrolling beat 'em up where you have to make your way from left to right and defeat a mastermind. There are 15 stages to complete, and have you patrolling through Liberty streets, car yards, stadiums, restaurants, the CBD, construction sites, and boat docks. While you're out on patrol, you can pick up ammunition, and the amount you get varies. For example, on some levels, ammo may be worth 10 bullets, while in others, you may get 60 bullets. Once you have obtained the cyber-suit, you wear it for the duration of the game.

        <desc>On childrens TV in the early 90s, Edd the Duck and Wilson the arm were the familiar puppets helping with the link sections. Like most child-oriented licenses of the day, his first computer outing was a platform game, scrolling vertically and resembling Rainbow Islands, although much simplified.

Edd must progress up the levels within the time limit (water will come up to drown him - presumably polluted water through which a duck can't swim), while collecting every star. Bad guys can be stunned by shooting them, which makes them safe to touch, although nothing other than Edd actually dies. The levels are all themed around particular areas of the BBC offices, including a sci-fi set and the weather room.

Some parts of the track are blocked unless you can shoot through obstacles before reaching them, or hit a jump pad. At some points you can change to travelling along the ceiling as well. Tokens can be collected en route, and used to obtain better weapons, but losing a life costs you the best one you’ve currently got.

        <name>Empire Strikes Back, The (48K)</name>
        <desc>The arcade game from Atari Games based on the second Star Wars movie features four action sequences inspired by the film. The graphical style is similar to the first Star Wars game, using vector graphics with a first-person perspective.

The first sequence takes place on the ice planet Hoth, where the player must destroy Imperial probe droids. The droids send transmissions to the Empire that can also be targeted and destroyed. Once enough transmissions have been sent, the Empire attacks.

In the second sequence, the player has to fend off Imperial walkers, either by shooting a limited number of tow cables at their feet or by targeting a small area at their head with lasers. But sooner or later, the Rebel base's power generator will be destroyed and the evacuation begins.

In the third sequence, the Millennium Falcon has to destroy TIE Fighters in space.

In the fourth and final sequence, the Falcon must navigate through an asteroid field, avoiding collisions.

Once the four sections have been completed, the game restarts at a higher difficulty level.

        <name>Enduro Racer (128K)</name>
        <desc>In this game you play the role of an endurance bike racer. The gameplay involves you racing against the clock to get to the finish line and jumping over ramps. At the end of each race you get points for how many cars or bikes you have overtaken with which you can upgrade your bike.
There are various different terrain for you to race on including desert beach and dirt tracks plus a number of things to slow you down or even knock you off of your bike all together. The main idea is to find the best route through each level to shave off valuable seconds in order to over take more cars and bikes.

The Japanese version of the game has more Tracks than the European and US versions have. Among  them is a snow track which is one of the hardest tracks in the game, because there is a lot of stones on the thin road.

        <desc>Sury Ani 7 has been a source of mined resources for many a year, but now that it is contaminated, the only way to harvest its bounty is to do so remotely. Worse still, the security system of defence droids is active, and primed to damage anything which attempts to penetrate the surface. 

As such, you are in control of a Dedicated Disposal Droid in, which must eventually shut down the security system and clear the area of radioactive material. This is done by throwing it down the disposal chute on each of the 8 levels, but you only have limited time before they explode. Fuel is limited and must be found within the complex, with the retro-thrust move using it up particularly quickly. To reach the next level you must find the appropriate pass.

It's a shooter similar to Gauntlet, only with an isometric viewpoint. You run around the levels shooting robots, rescuing humans and picking up items.

        <desc>La Espada Sagrada is an arcade-videoadventure mix that consists of 3 phases, 2 of them inspired by the classic videoadventure genre of the eighties and the third being a classical arcade game.

The hero player (Atahualpa Yupanqui) aims to obtain 'The Sacred Sword', and problems through the 2 early stages must be solved in order to find it. Then in a third phase full of action, take advantage of that sword to be victorious.

The two early stages have no side scrolling, while the third one is an arcade with horizontal scroll and non-stop action and big sprites.

To access levels 2 and 3 you need a code, which is provided once you finish the previous one.

As well as his lady Wilma, his mates Tom, Dick and Harry come under your control as well, and you have to indirectly guide Wally's son Herbert. You've discovered a safe, but need to find the five parts of the code - each character is searching for a particular one. Their respective professions dictate which tasks they can perform - plumbing, electrical work and car maintenance for example. Objects must be collected and manipulated to accomplish all this. There are plenty of reaction and timing tests along the way, as well as hidden games.

        <desc>This action game combines shoot 'em up and platform elements, as you control a flying man who can gain an exoskeletal suit for extra protection (hence the name). Your task is to progress from left to right in each level, either along the ground or by using the arrangement of platforms. Most of the baddies can be avoided rather than shot, and this is often easier, especially as you can duck or jump to avoid them. As well as a standard gun (activated by tapping fire) you also have a limited number of missiles to take out installations (activated by holding down fire, which makes autofire facilities useless). The scrolling is flick-screen, perhaps as the game was designed for the C64, and the Amiga version was identical to the ST's.

        <desc>Of all the mundane tasks which've been turned into action-packed games, bug-repelling must be up there with being a Paper Boy or a Trashman. These aren't average bugs; Chicago is under siege from mutated insects, rats and even toy tanks.

You'll have to work through seven houses, each of which has the typical rooms. You control a seemingly-dismembered hand, which must deal with the hordes as they come towards it, into the screen. They can be shot, thumped, or squashed depending on their type. To clear a room you must kill a certain number of creatures in each of the vertically-divided 'lanes' of the room - this causes squares on the ground to change colour.

        <desc>Your task in Extreme essentially involves wiping out alien pirates, across 3 distinct sections. This was essentially a spare-time pet project, so you would expect some of the most advanced graphics and special effects you'll ever see on a Spectrum.

The first level involves flying around in a ship shooting out aliens, with contact depleting your energy (and causing the screen border to flash). The second section involves travelling underwater, running into landmines to set off explosions to kill surrounding enemies. The final part sees you travelling through a  building in a huge droid, taking out everything in your path. The game is quite short, and would take around 20 minutes to play through.

It is up to you to plan your flight route by setting waypoints on the tactical map prior to take-off; you can also (but need not) select the armament of your plane. When you have accumulated enough flight experience, you may command entire squadrons in the fictional Operation Conquest campaign, a simple simulation of an entire war theater that already hinted at what would later become DI’s Virtual Battlefield.

F-16 Combat Pilot allows multiplayer duels via modem or serial link.

        <name>Fernando Martin Basket Master (Spanish) (48K)</name>
        <desc>"Basket Master" is a one-on-one basketball game from premier Spanish developer Dinamic Soft, dedicated to NBA player Fernando Martín, the first Spanish (and first European non-student in a US university) to play in the NBA, who tragically died 3 years later in a traffic accident at the age of 28. 

The focus is on pure, unadulterated action here: just choose one- or two-player game, and presto-- you'll be out on a CGA court trying to score. Although difficulty level can be toggled ("amateur" or "NBA").

Basket Master was originally for 8 bits computers, platforms for which appeared December of 1986 after several delays.

        <desc>An impossible mission has fallen into the most improbable hands. Poor Nimrod is sent to rescue a few of his Biopton companions from the hands of the brutal Cratons, who have imprisoned them in a chain of prison planets collectively known as "The Matrix".

Nimrod must travel throughout the galaxy, infiltrate each planet where matrix activity is detected and rescue his friends. He may use the objects left at his disposal, such as TV cameras, which provide valuable intel about each complex, the ammo crates, which contain weapons needed to defeat the disruptors and guards, and the building blocks, which can be used as protection or to activate weight sensors.

At the same time, he must avoid, if possible, the armed guards, the disruptors, which will block his way, the mines and the black ice. Once Nimrod locates a hostage, he needs  to take him to the landing zone and extract him to his spaceship in order to complete the rescue.

"The final matrix" is an isometric arcade with adventure elements, such as puzzles and traps. A novelty feature is that every matrix can be entered at any time, following no particular order, which may appeal to casual players.

He sends you into the castle of Spiteland, which is overloading with treasures to uncover. Whether you return with them to please the King, or simply flee with everything you can get, is up to you.

Either way, the gameplay is platform-based, with enemies floating around to rob you of energy on contact. There are also scrolling mazes to move through. As you collect objects (often by using some of the other items you collect, to create chemical reactions of sorts and adding an element of lateral thinking), you must try to trade them for the most valuable items you can get.

        <desc>In the game, you, as commander of the Firefly, must destroy the 'mechanoid system framework' that your enemy has created by destroying its energy source.

The framework is represented as a grid of squares or sectors.  Ultimately you must reach and destroy the power source, at the far right of the grid, whilst at the start of the game you only have access to the 'dead zone', at the far left of the grid, and those squares immediately adjacent.  This can be extended as described below.

Planetary sectors are systems with planets in them, and cannot be entered as they are the enemy's main colonies, so are too well defended.  Thus they block the path.

Unconstructed regions can be taken over, turning them into part of the dead zone, by bypassing the 'instrusion detection' alarm system.  The system involves the cursor flicking between 'thumbs up' and 'thumbs down' symbols, and you must press fire when 'thumbs up' is displayed to take over the system.  A thumbs down will scramble the squares on the grid.

The main part of the game takes place when you try to take over an occupied zone.  Here the game is a shoot-em-up, where you can move freely in two dimensions, and shoot at your enemies.  Your ammunition orbits you, and when fired takes a moment to come back to you, so you can temporarily run out of ammo if you fire too quickly.  .

In an occupied zone there are 4 energy points that you must destroy.  To destroy an energy source you must collect 4 zokas, or excess energy units from it, then enter, and select a thumbs up as  the cursor alternates between it and a thumbs down.  The cursor alternates more quickly in successive energy points.  

Teleports can be used, to move between areas, but when you attempt to use one, your ship rotates whilst pointing at a set of alternating green and red dots in a circle.  You must hit the fire button 3 times in succession, when the ship is pointing at a green dot, with the ship spinning faster each time. 

If you take too much damage your ship explodes, and you lose a life, and re-enter the grid, with the occupied zone still occupied.  However, if you successfully destroy all 4 energy points, the occupied zone becomes part of the dead zone as you re-enter the grid.

Initially you have no weaponry as you progress through the 500 screens of Atic Atac-influenced streets and towns, but fireballs can be collected and used against the Queen's forces.

Trading is a large part of the game, a unique aspect for a game of this type at the time. While many objects are lying around, many more must be obtained by entering the homes of people, and negotiating with them to arrange a swap. You can also attempt to steal from them, but you risk being caught and sentenced to death (losing a life in the process).

        <name>Flintstones, the (128K)</name>
        <desc>The Flintstones is a game based on the popular cartoon series The Flintstones by Hanna-Barbera Productions Inc.

It's weekend! Fred Flintstone thinks of only one thing: bowling  
with his friend and neighbor Barney.
Unfortunately, his wife Wilma got other plans for him. Fred has to paint the living room and Wilma is not going to help him with it. No, she goes shopping.
And if that's not enough, Wilma also tells Fred that his mother-in-law is coming over.

The Flintstones game is divided in four parts.

Part 1: Painting the walls of your living room.
To go to the bowling alley before it is closed Fred has to paint  the walls as quickly as possible. To paint the walls Fred uses the tail of a living squirrel. 
Pebbles tries to leap out her playpen and starts crawling around and starts scribbling on the walls. If Fred wants to put Pebbles back in the playpen then he has to drop the squirrel, that immediately starts wandering off. When Pebbles is back in the playpen Fred has to chase the squirrel and dip its tail in the paint again.

Part 2: Driving your car on the way to the bowling center.
Finally, when all walls are painted Fred can go to the bowling  
alley!
Fred has to drive to the bowling alley but unfortunately the roads are in a very bad condition. The road surface is dire and covered with rocks!
And if one of the wheels hit a bump it will break off the car and disappear into the distance.

Part 3: A bowling competition between Fred and Barney.
At the bowling alley the following bowling parameters can be set: the spin and speed of the ball and the starting position of the player.
Each turn gives two throws (except he gets a strike). A game  
takes ten turns. while a match takes three games.

Part 4: Saving Pebbles at a construction site.
On his way home Fred discovers that Pebbles has disappeared!  Don't let Wilma find that out!
Fred finds Pebbles at a construction site on top of some

        <name>Flunky (48K)</name>
        <desc>A Flunky is a male servant who must do routine jobs for his masters; in this game you are a Flunky and your masters are the British Royal Family. There are five tasks to be undertaken – light all the fires, fetching a toy boat from the bath for Prince Andrew, some freckles for Fergie, a wig for Diana, and a mystery task for the Queen. To gain access to each room, you need the signatures of particular royals along the way. 

Flunky is an arcade adventure using the same game system as other Don Priestley's Trapdoor license – large sprites overlaid onto block objects, seemingly designed around Spectrum attribute-clash issues. Many screens operate on more than 1 horizontal plane, so you can move your character in and out of the screens as well as across them. Guards will shoot at you if you attempt to access restricted areas, so be careful.

        <desc>After the success of Football Manager, this was one of the first rival attempts. You can choose any league team to manage, although they always start in the 4th division.

You will have to hire scouting, physiotherapy and coaching staff before you can do much - you can also hire a youth team for the chance of uncovering a rough diamond. Each week there are up to 2 players available to sign, who are (like your own players) rated out of 10 for form - players with more than 5 will rarely want to play in division 4. Matches are played outside your view, with a minute-by-minute update, and all the other results afterwards.

Money management is all-important; you can improve your stadium, sell players, take out a loan, and pay for your club's insurance. Injuries and suspensions, as well as cup and eventually European matches, all add to the challenge.

You start in the 4th division with the team of your choice, and can play on indefinitely in the hope of reaching the top division and dominating it, as well as winning the cups. Players can be bought or sold, with their transfer values varying according to the size of any bid. Their skills and morale vary as the season goes on, with resting key players in easy matches often a key move. You can take out a loan, limited depending on your division, while day-to-day bills must be covered. Matches feature short animated highlights sequences of key moments.

        <desc>Football Manager from Addictive was the first game of its kind, and this sequel followed several years later, absorbing ideas from the many similar games released in between. Teams can now choose formations, and assign man-to-man marking. Players have individual skills and fitness ratings, in a more realistic way, with half-time substitutions and tactical changes supported. The whole 92-club league is incorporated, as is the League Cup alongside the FA Cup. It is now possible to watch and assess the individual performance of the players, with match graphics differentiating the attack / midfield / defense areas more clearly. Training allows passing length and height to be specified.

You start with a small amount of money, which is used to buy goal cards; each of these sets you up a chance in a match. Up to three can be played in each game, making Hat-Tricks a possibility.

The action sequences involve studying a move plan on the chalkboard, then getting into the right position to execute the final shot. Fail to score enough goals and you may lose your place in the team; do especially well and you may gain a transfer up the league.

        <desc>Fed up with football (soccer) management games, with all the match strategies, financial turmoil and prima donna players? This game offers a unique twist, leaving you 'managing' the career of a single player, involving matches and transfers.

You start with 10 'goal cards' - up to 3 can be played in each match, each of them giving you a shooting chance, at which point arcade action skill comes in. The better you perform, the higher your wages are, the more chance you have of a big-money transfer and international call-up, and the less chance you have of being dropped from the team.

There's also a trivia section, which asks increasingly difficult questions allowing you to go double or nothing on knowing the answers - up to £8000 a time can be won on this.

You'll be foraging both above and below ground, with rabbits and hens on offer to kill, and apples and milk (yes, I know foxes are purely carnivorous) can be collected. All of this must be brought back to the home before to complete each level. All manner of nasties are thrown at you, including eggs (from hens), nuts (from squirrels) and rocks (from badgers)

You must avoid dangerous acid drops, mummies, spiders, vampires, etc. In order to defend yourself from those disagreeable enemies you have at your disposition a gun (with limited bullets), but some enemies are immune to guns, and you must jump or avoid them.

After one of his last "little" parties he decided to take the controls of his spaceship in not very appropriated conditions to pilot, so our sidereal playboy went to play with meteorites under the effects of drunkenness. Evidently this diversion could not have finished very well, he crashed with a meteorite, lost the control of his spaceship and fell with it to planet Ternat's moon, where it's located the enemy base of Kaldar. Injured and laughing, he managed to left the smoky spaceship and slowly noticed that in such a place he wouldn't be received in a very friendly way. Already recovered of his dunk, Freddy Hardest, who although could not look it, is one of the most intelligent members of the Sidereal Free Planet Confederation's SPEA Agency Service of Counterespionage, he must start the adventure.

        <name>Frogger (128K) (HB)</name>
        <desc>Frogger is a variant of the arcade game of the same name. The basic premise is to guide frogs to safety by climbing a 3rd person viewed screen within a time limit, first by crossing a busy road avoiding contact with traffic, then by crossing a river without making contact with the water, then by safely reaching one of the homecells at the top of the screen. Alternating lanes of traffic move in opposite directions and at varying speeds, and the river flow sees alternate 'lanes' of logs and crocodiles (avoid the heads!) moving in opposite directions. Another additional challenge is that each homecell can only be used once - emptying an occupied one costs you a life - once all have been filled a bonus is awarded and all are cleared,

In this variant there is also a short maze to clear between the road and river, hitting any of the edges of these also kills your frog. There are stationary lanes of traffic at each end</desc>

        <name>Frogger (48K)</name>
        <desc>Frogger is a variant of the arcade game of the same name. The basic premise is to guide frogs to safety by climbing a 3rd person viewed screen within a time limit, first by crossing a busy road avoiding contact with traffic, then by crossing a river without making contact with the water, then by safely reaching one of the homecells at the top of the screen. Alternating lanes of traffic move in opposite directions and at varying speeds, and the river flow sees alternate 'lanes' of logs and crocodiles (avoid the heads!) moving in opposite directions. Another additional challenge is that each homecell can only be used once - emptying an occupied one costs you a life - once all have been filled a bonus is awarded and all are cleared,

In this variant there is also a short maze to clear between the road and river, hitting any of the edges of these also kills your frog. There are stationary lanes of traffic at each end</desc>

        <name>Frost Byte (48K)</name>
        <desc>In Frost Byte you control Hickey the Kreezer, an elastic curve which moves sideways, jumps and shoots. You must navigate your way through planet Cosmica, and rescue your brethren, within the limited 'Twang' energy you have. 

Cosmica is full of hideous monsters, many of which can be shot. Your character builds momentum as it moves, so some hazards are easier to clear from a running start. You can only jump vertically, although you have control as the character falls. Ammunition is limited, and must be collected throughout your quest.

Three sweets which enhance your character can be collected - the red one increases your speed, blue increases the height of your leap, and green means you can safely fall further. There are additional objects to pick up and use as well.

        <name>Fruit Machine Simulator 2 - Mega Trek (128K)</name>
        <desc>This is the sequel to Codemaster's  Fruit Machine Simulator and is programmed by the same people who developed the original.

It is a game for 1 - 4 players. Each player is given £1.50 stake money which is represented as a series of coins. These coins are fed into the machine by pressing the appropriate action key, zero feeds in £1 for example.

Once the machine has been fed all the player has to do is spin the reels and see what happens. When a winning combination appears the game offers the chance to gamble it for a higher or lower win

Some symbols have numbers on them. If these appear on the winning line they light corresponding number of letters in the MEGA-TREK feature. When all letters are lit the game activates the feature and the player can advance through the feature to higher winnings. Randomly the game will hold the MEGA-TREK lights from one spin to the next increasing the chances of triggering the feature.
There are some reels with '?' on them, these cause all the unlit lights to flash randomly and the player can activate the feature by pressing the action key when the last light is lit.

The game also has many other standard features such as hold and nudge together with special features including

1.  Shuffle-Nudge box where you can shuffle the reels but each shuffle costs a nudge

  Winner-Spinner where the reels spin until you stop them to select the best win

  4 Coin boxes

        <desc>The Citizens Defence Force does not trust the United Nations to keep a troubled 21st century world at peace. It confiscates a horde of planes and warships, and as a UN loyalist, it is your job to shoot them down. Solving starvation and disease can wait, apparently.

The game is split into 8 stages, which are split into sub-stages over land and sea, each of which has a strict time limit, and a target number of planes to shoot down. They take place from behind your plane, which can be controlled with ‘up’ referring to ‘climb’ or ‘dive’, depending on player preference. You are armed with 10 missiles as well as standard weapons. The plane can survive a few hits, so watch the damage report as it goes from red to black. 

Fail to complete a section in the time limit and you use up a continue, but the amount of planes previously shot down is not reset, making the second attempt easier Chase HQ style. As you destroy enemies you gain access to better planes, and the rank reported at the end of the game improves – this is also dependent on the skill level you play at.

The player moves left and right to aim at an alien, then shoots a bullet up the screen, and the alien it hits is killed. The aliens are classed as Drones, Emissaries, Hornets and Commanders, with those higher up the screen scoring more points when destroyed. At set intervals an enemy will move down the screen towards you, escorting a bomber, which is a moment of high danger. Clear a wave and another is generated.

        <desc>In the earliest licensed entertainment videogame of Jim Davis' lazy cat cartoon character, you play Garfield in his attempt to rescue Arlene from the cat pound. The primary gameplay involves object manipulation, gaining objects either by picking up or receiving them from other characters (usually in exchange for other objects). 

Most characters from the cartoons play a part in the game. Odie the dog follows you around - swipe him for points. Garfield's cousin Nermal can help you out. They can also carry objects for Garfield's use.

Garfield needs regular food and rest - without one of these he falls asleep and it is Game Over. Contact with many foes is draining. A butcher's is one major food source.

        <desc>After a fruitful day spent on his favorite hobby (food, what else?), Garfield the cat falls asleep next to Jon's still open fridge. The chill coming out of the refrigerator induces a dream of the Swiss Alps, with Garfield going after the largest lasagna factory in the world and a mythical chicken that can lay chocolate eggs. It is the player's goal to make sure Garfield's dream comes to a happy ending before he wakes up. 

Garfield: Winter's Tail comprises of three different mini-games.The first one has Garfield skiing downhill towards a ski-jump that will lead him straight to the rooftop of the lasagna factory. The second mini-game is set in the chocolate factory where the mythical chicken is employed: Garfield must ensure all the mechanical chickens in the factory are provided their chocolate supply flowing through a pipeline. Finally, he must ice-skate across a frozen lake, following the trail of chocolate footsteps left by the chicken.

As a disturbing element, Odie appears throughout the whole game. The drooling dog can steal some of the food Garfield needs to replenish his energy, but he can also tamper with the lift controls in the factory and saw holes in the frozen lake.

The three mini-games can be played in any order. However, playing the whole game from the skiing level first is the only way to be able to see the ending.

        <name>Gary Lineker's Hot-Shot! (48K)</name>
        <desc>Gary Lineker's Hot-Shot! is a soccer game in which two teams try to win the match. The adjustable options are the number of players, the time of a half time and the AI level. The game is played in a top-down view and only shows a part of the playfield.

The player either controls the athlete in ball possession or, when in defense, the one which is nearest. When shooting, the power of the shot depends on how long the button was pressed and the direction changes with the joystick movement, e.g. moving against the walking direction results in a overhead kick.</desc>

        <desc>Gary Linekers Superskills is a soccer game with a catch: it is only about the training! The player has to solve a sequence of mini games in a limited amount of time (overall). The mini games are divided into three basic categories: gym (button mashing), ball juggling (using moves with the right timing) and field event. The latter is also split into three succeeding disciplines: dribbling around obstacles, penalty and kicking the ball through hung up tyres.</desc>

        <name>Gary Lineker's Super Star Soccer (48K)</name>
        <desc>Much of the design and programming of Superstar Ice Hockey (by many of the same programmers) is revised to provide a six-a-side soccer game. You can control any combination of centre-forward, goalkeeper (on the C64) and manager. For much of the game you are merely the centre-forward as the action unfolds around you - don't be afraid to track back and help out. 

The ball sticks closely to a player, who can pass, shoot, head or bicycle-kick it. Goalkeepers are penalised for retaining possession for too long (a rule later adapted for use in real-life football). Match length can be between 6 and 90 minutes, by toggling the speed at which time moves. Fouls are fully implemented.

Single matches can be played in the cassette version, but the disk version adds a full-season structure. 64 English teams are split into 4 divisions of 16, with a season consisting of either 7 or 15 matches.

        <name>Gauntlet (128K)</name>
        <desc>Gauntlet, the original arcade smash hit, is a fighting game where you choose a character and let rip into the hordes of enemies that assault you on you way to the end of the level. One or two players must make their way through 100 levels of mayhem and magic. 

It featured a choice of four characters to play with, each with different weapons. Thor the Warrior, has a  bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the Valkyrie, has a close range sword, Questor the Elf has his long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has magical bolts.

Ghosts, goblins and even the life draining Death are your enemies. Enemies stream out of generators, so destroy these before tackling the rest. 

Keys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain only bonus items, not a progressive route.  Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces your energy level.
Treasure is abundant throughout the levels and adds to your score.

        <name>Gauntlet III - The Final Quest (128K)</name>
        <desc>Like in the prequels you empty areas infested by all kinds of enemies while running for the exit. Like this was rather a straight forward thing in the first two games, it's not that easy to finish a level anymore. While you only had to run until you find the exit (and besides killing hordes of enemies you probably find some keys to unlock doors leading to deeper dungeons) you might have to solve a few "quests" to proceed to the next level in this installment.
These "quests" are very basic, for example you have to find object A, then bring it to B, advance to C and finally go to D to uncover the exit.
The big difference is the graphics. While you had a top down view in the first 2 games Gauntlet 3 has an isometric kind of view.
The old 4 characters (warrior, wizard, elf and valkyrie) are ready for action again and this time they get backup by 4 new characters which include the Lizard, Neptune, Stoneman and the Iceman.

        <desc>Humans and aliens are living in harmony in the future, until a tabloid journalist stirs up hatred towards aliens. They respond by invading the planet, and it's down to you to clear up a situation scarily similar to reality in this arcade conversion.

Gemini Wing is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up, which is distinguished by its unusual power-up system. Instead of gaining occasional tokens which lead to lasting weaponry improvements, occasional flurries of tokens are released to ensure a quick burst of improved fire. The organic backgrounds are detailed, and have many sections which fire at you.

        <desc>Your mission is quite simple: kill as many enemies as possible, while trying to stay alive. First, you must escape from Earth, to visit five planets and get a part of the Genesis on each one. Once you have successfully assembled the spaceship, you will use it to get back to Earth and free us from the Dork menace.

Your ship has two different shoot types: normal shoot, which will be used to fire the weapons equipped by your ship at any time, and a megablast, which will kill every enemy around you. To activate the megablast, keep the fire button pressed, until the power bar located on the lower-right side of the screen is filled up. The blast will be launched when you release the fire button. You have an unlimited number of normal shoots and a very limited amount of available megablasts, so use them wisely.</desc>

        <desc>Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.

As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.

        <desc>Ghosts'n Goblins is a sideways scrolling action platformer spread over six levels, each of which must be completed within three minutes (or a life is lost), taking in forest, village, mountain and cavern settings with increasing difficulty.

Arthur the brave knight must rescue his beloved Princess from the Demon King Astaroth and his forces - amongst them are the various undead (ghosts, zombies), bats, ogres and goblins. Other challenges include moving platforms, ladders and water/fire hazards. 

As in most games in this genre, the player can pick up power-ups such as daggers and bombs during the course of the game, giving the player greater firepower.

        <desc>Three years have passed since Arthur defeated the Demon King Astaroth and rescued his beloved Princess Prin-Prin (see Ghosts 'N Goblins). A new villain, the Great Demon King Lucifer (Loki in some versions) has become the new leader of Ghoul Realm. While returning from a journey, Arthur sees the Princess' castle and her village under attack by Lucifer's forces. While rushing towards her beloved knight, the Princess is struck by one of Lucifer's laser beams.

Now, Arthur must venture back to the Lucifer's palace and destroy the demon in order to rescue the Princess' soul and bring her back to life! And it won't matter whether he fights in his shining armor or in his underwear alone...the bravest Knight in the land isn't going to be stopped by some monsters! Although the game starts with graveyard and marsh territory familiar from the first game, later levels are set in a tower, a mass of skeletons, and a castle.

Players progress from left to right (from bottom to top in level 3), and have to hack down the aforementioned monsters with a sword. The journey includes ledges, ladders, lava pits and slippery slopes. Different weapons can be collected, by finding suits of armor inside chests. Each of the five stages has its own setting and a final boss.

        <name>Gift from the Gods (48K)</name>
        <desc>Set in the Palace of Mycenae in Ancient Greece, it follows the trials and tribulations of Orestes who, under the directions of the Gods Zeus and Apollo, must avenge the murder of his father, Basileus Agamemnon. Orestes must fulfill his destiny by trial in the Labyrinth beneath the palace and find the solution to the puzzle, or perish in the attempt.

Hidden in 16 special rooms are objects, known as Euclidian shapes, geometric designs based on triangles, circles and squares; six of which, when correctly positioned in the Guardian's Chamber, reveal the exit. Orestes has some help from his sister Electra, who has been imprisoned in the Labyrinth, and she can guide him to where the shapes are hidden, but Orestes has to decide himself what shapes he must take to the Guardian's Chamber. Illusionary creatures created by the Demi-Gods try to sap Orestes' strength, but in certain rooms, life-giving water drips from the roof, replenishing energy and stamina. The Demi-Gods have also created illusory Euclidian shapes as which sit beside the real ones, and although these do not fool Electra, she isn't always around to help. The other problem is his mother, Clytaemnestra, who has learned of his task and has entered the labyrinth to kill Electra.</desc>

        <desc>The World Government has taken the decision to wipe out the Abraxas Corporation, a weaponry-dealing regime that has helped dictators and terrorists for decades. As a member of the elite Silent But Deadly force, you have been sent in to destroy their plastic island, most importantly their 10 reactors. The twist is that you are expected to do this on board a rickety hang-glider.

Everything on the island must be bombed using your grenades, but the most efficient method of travel is to hug the ground and stay low, so a balance must be found to be in the sky at the right times. Each reactor is protected by lasers, although by running into the nearest control tower these can be sent haywire for long enough to allow you to jump in and destroy them.

        <desc>Gonzzalezz is a side-scrolling platform game from Spain. The main protagonist is a Mexican stereotype (complete with sombrero and huge mustache), that has an obsession with the traditional siesta. The game is divided in two loads:

? In the first one, Gonzalez must escape his own nightmare. He moves by executing precise jumps in one big level divided in seven sections, a surreal landscape littered with dangerous objects like flying vacuum-cleaners, disembodied hands, etc. The Q key is the jump button, while the O and P move him left and right respectively.

 ? In the second load, Gonzalez must find his hammock while avoiding the dangers of a stereotypical Mexican landscape (Indian tribes, wild animals, etc). Weapons and ammunition are scattered in one large level divided in sections. He can collect or drop these by crouching with the A key and can use them with the SPACE bar.

        <name>Goonies, The (48K)</name>
        <desc>Datasoft's The Goonies is one of the most fondly-remembered games in the genre of platform action-adventure-puzzle games for which Datasoft was known (other games included Conan: Hall of Volta, Bruce Lee, and Zorro, all well-regarded classics).

The game is licensed from the internationally-beloved Steven Speilberg film of the same name, in which a motley crew of suburban kids in Astoria, Oregon, must save their homes from being foreclosed upon and find their salvation in a treasure map leading to an old pirate ship in a cavern.  However, they must maneuver around an eccentric family of Italian criminals -- the Fratellis -- on the lam, who are also on the trail of the treasure.

The game is divided into a series of eight screens based on scenes from the film, each of which contains unique and creative puzzles that must be solved by coordinating the activities of two of the kids from the Goonies (and in the last screen, the elephant-man-like Sloth) without getting killed by deadly bats, homicidal Fratellis, flying demon-skull thingies, or other environmental hazards.  For example, in one screen one player must wind up and hold a winch that lifts a large stone so that the other player can pass it, run backward on a ball floating in deadly water, bypass a series of three water buckets going up and down that kill you if you do not time your passage underneath correctly, jump to the top of a rail, and slide across to grab the key to the door below -- and all this without getting hit by a wandering bat.

One of the characteristic elements of this series of games is that it was organized more like an arcade game than an adventure game; the game kept a score and a high score, you got a certain number of lives, which would be replenished at certain points or at certain score totals, and there was no save feature.  In other words, the game had to be played all in one sitting, near-perfectly, to see the ending.  As might be expected, not many people finished these games.  (However, nowadays with emulators and memory-state-saving features, this is no longer such a frustrating problem.)

The Goonies can be played single-player, with the joystick button used to switch between the two characters on-screen, or cooperatively, with each player controlling one of the characters.

You can drive a McLaren, Ferrari or Williams car, each with different qualities, around the real-life Formula One circuits including Monaco, Suzuka and the original Hockenheim circuit characterized by long straights. Rival drivers also have their own styles and strengths, and to win the World Championship you will have to master these. Pitstop timing and planning is crucial as well, although only tires are changed in late-1980s F1. Graphics are sprite-based.

        <desc>Calling it a 'simulator' was a stretch, as with many of Codemasters' titles. In reality it was an overhead-view Super Sprint style arcade racer for 1 or 2 players, similar in many ways to the company's BMX Simulator. 

There were up to 14 circuits depending on the format, which incorporated many underpasses (some of them deliberately unrealistic) and tight curves. There were oil slicks to avoid and points bonuses to pick up.

The cars have slow acceleration but a lot of power down the straights. You are scored based on your overall time and your fastest lap. Lose to the computer car and it's game over.

As before, the action is viewed from overhead across a succession of tracks featuring hairpins, oil slicks and similar hazards. You must complete each race within the time limit; and time left after one race is added to your allowance on the next one. After the race you can view a replay.

The two main new features are a 3-player mode (there are always 3 cars present in total) and a damage meter which mean that repeat contract with barriers or other cars hampers your performance.

        <desc>El propósito de los experimentos en el laboratorio era estudiar la naturaleza de los campos gravitacionales.

Como resultado de numerosos experimentos, se creó un bot universal que puede cambiar fácilmente la localización del campo gravitacional. Después de completar el programa de investigación, tuvimos un pequeño problema: no sabemos cómo deshacernos de los viejos modelos de robots en las salas experimentales.

Su tarea es limpiar las habitaciones de los robots antiguos utilizando el último modelo de robot de gravedad, utilizando trampas de gravedad fallidas y olvidadas.</desc>

        <name>Great Escape, The (48K)</name>
        <desc>The Great Escape is an isometric action-adventure game.

Gather round, kids, and listen to grandpa tell of his time as a prisoner of war in Germany. ‘Twas back in 1942. Those were rough times, lads. Rough times. Been shot down in my plane. Darn shame it was, it being a good plane and all. Next I know, there’s this group of German soldiers standing round me, and off we go to a P.O.W. camp. Big thing, that, plenty of guards all around with a keen eye on your every move, and full of unfortunate souls like myself. Just that they do naught but sit all day and sob and generally be no great help when it comes to doing the Great Escape. But not me, no sir! I showed them Germans, I did, and I was out of their fashionable high security “he who comes here, stays here” camp in no time. You wanna hear that story? Bet you do!

Controlling a prisoner of war in a German camp, your goal is to break out undetected. There are numerous ways to freedom – back doors, cracked fences, even underground tunnels. However, you have to plan your escape while obeying the strict rules of the camp. 

Number one: Daily program. You have to attend two roll calls a day, one meal, one exercise, and stay in bed at night. Failure to appear at any of these events will result in the alarm being rung. When you do not touch the controls, your protagonist will move automatically, going to all important events. You have to detect and use gaps in the time-table to explore the camp. 

Rule number two: guard rooms are off limits. If a soldier catches you in a room that is forbidden, you will be placed in solitary confinement. Of course, you have to enter restricted parts of the camp to find items crucial for your escape. The moral flag will turn from green to red to indicate that you are in an area where you shouldn’t be. 

Rule no three: no prisoner may carry forbidden objects. When you are caught in a suspicious situation, you will be stripped of all items that you found so far. To avoid that, you have to deposit objects in a safe place. You need to find keys to open locked doors, uniforms for camouflage, flashlights to see in dark tunnels, and many more. 

Rule number four: guard commands are to be obeyed at all times. The German soldiers patrol on fixed routes and have a line of sight. You have to learn the guard’s routes and sneak past their backs to avoid detection when breaking out. If you are caught, your morale will decrease. If your morale reaches zero, your will to escape is broken.

Unfortunately, Catheter gets word of your plans, and mixes up a whole new batch of vicious gremlins. As a result, your mission is now one of destruction and avoidance.

Elite's implementation of this is a five-level side-view action game, in which you run around avoiding or shooting the gremlins. Each level has a secret object which must be collected. Bonus items such as extra lives and time can be collected, as can improved weapons, and credits to spend on a new weapon after each level.

        <desc>A tropical island (specified as Cuba in the Japanese original) is being oppressed by a dictator, but fortunately one or two brave US soldiers (Ernesto "Che" Guevara in the Japanese version) are on hand to restore justice. March through the rivers, swamps and forests to overthrow the dictator (specified as Batista in Japan) in this evolution of the Commando style.

The game scrolls vertically, as you move up the screen shooting enemies, finding good strategic firing points and collecting powerups. As the enemy soldiers come towards you in groups, some care is required when picking them off, either using your gun or the grenades. There are also hostages carried by some soldiers, with points bonuses for not shooting these but shooting their captors. Each level ends with a boss.

You control an arsenal that includes laser-guided Hellfire missles, a 30mm cannon controlled by helmet gunsights, clusters of bombardment rockets--even air-to-air missles for duels with enemy helicopters.

Gunship starts with flight training at a base in the USA.  Tutorials teach you to handle the copter; once the controls and flying skills are mastered, there are escalating challenges and hundreds of missions in any one of four regions of the world, including Southeast Asia, Central America, the Middle East, and the USSR and it's Warsaw Pact allies in Western Europe.

        <desc>Hostile All-Terrain Encounters await in this shoot 'em up notable for it's unusual diagonal scroll, which is similar to Costa Panayi's previous Highway Encounter series. As nobody is qualified to take the enemy on, your task is to complete the 30 levels of training (the actual war could've been the basis for a sequel, although this never happened).

The levels alternate between controlling a Star Fighter plane and a Ground Assault Vehicle; the latter is faster but is confined to ground motion. The plane can move up and down to make dodging the simulated enemy fire easier. This generally comes at you in waves, although there are also ground installations.

Central to the game is to shoot at the cases of plasma crystals, and then fly over these so as to carry them to the end of the level. Dying loses you one of these crystals if you have at least one, or a life if you do not. Completing a level with at least 2 crystals is effectively a restart point as well, as when you die you are sent back to a level in which you collected at least 2.

This works perfectly for Centro-Holographis until two of their droids, Hammerfist (male) and Metalisis (female) malfunction. They try to put things right, and come under your control in this side-view action game with adventure elements.

You can switch between the two characters at any moment, and must use this wisely as their abilities differ greatly. On each screen you must kill all enemies, as well as taking out the robots which keep the doors locked.

        <name>Hard Drivin' (128K)</name>
        <desc>Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... 

The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on. 

Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is "reset" and you get up to speed again. 

The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.

As a result, you must dive into the game's world to complete the story, and ensure that evil doesn't win, by saving the white pages and destroying the black ones.

There are six levels, all with distinctly cutesy themes and colourful graphics. The level layouts are extremely complicated, and you have to make your way back to base after each one, before being transported onto the next one, all within a time limit. The levels are full of wizards who must be shot, as well as a small amount of character interaction.

        <desc>In this beat 'em up game you control Hercules, the illegitimate son of Zeus and the mortal woman Alcmene. Hera, Zeus' wife, therefore hates Hercules and made him kill his two children. 
The King of Argos gives him 12 labours that he has to fulfill.

These twelve labours are symbolized by icons that appear occasionally on the screen. You have to collect these labours while fighting off skeletons that carry swords.  The fights take place in ancient Greek temples amongst other places.
If you hit a labour it will put into an urn but a spider tries to steal the labours from you. Kill it with a well placed blow.
If all twelve labours have been collected he must face the the end boss of the game, the mighty Minotaur.

        <desc>The famous fantasy-themed board game was converted into an isometric-viewed role playing game in which the evil Wizard Morcar must be defeated. You take control of a wizard, a dwarf, a barbarian and an elf, each with different strengths and weaknesses, who each start the 14 missions from opposite sides of the board.

Strict turn-based movement rules apply, as actions other than movement can only be carried out before or after the move, the size of which is limited by a dice roll. These moves are carried out using an icon-based system. Characters can fight the many monsters which lurk, or cast spells to vanquish them. There are magic potions to uncover, but also hidden traps, so mapping is advised. Treasure can be collected, and traded at the shop after each level.

        <desc>A Hero Quest expansion pack with a set of new quests (adapted from a similar expansion to the original board game). This time the quests follow an ongoing storyline. The Witch Lord is back, and the heroes enter the ruined city Kalos to find and defeat him. Return of the Witch Lord plays similarly to the original game, but as the manual warns, is more difficult.

For the DOS version of the game, the expansion pack was only available through the Hero Quest + Hero Quest: Return of the Witch Lord bundle.

        <desc>In this isometric 3D action-strategy game, the player uses a Vorton droid to push a bomb to the end of the highway into an alien base. There are 30 screens, most of them filled with hazards trying to block (like barrels) or destroy (mines and aliens) your bomb. 

The perspective and guidance concept are not the game's only original features; there are 4 more bombs with you, representing your extra lives - pushing you forward on your mission. If these other Vortons are destroyed, one of your extra lives is lost without the player being able to use it.

In this game Baron Von Bankjob has escaped from jail and it is up to Hong Kong Phooey to find him. The game starts off with the trademark scene of Hong Kong Phooey jumping out of his file cabinet as seen on the animated TV show. From there on you must maneuver yourself through each of the levels full of obstacles like the Baron's thugs, collapsing platforms, conveyor belts, oil and acid patches. Hong Kong Phooeys health is displayed via the "Hong Kong Phooey Book of Kung Fu" meter located on the bottom left of the screen. Collect drinks to help replenish your health, unlock doors and activate switches to help advance further into the level to find Baron Von Bankjob and bring him to justice.

Each one of the balls must deal with several hazards, by jumping over them or crushing them. Collision with any of these will cause a ball to burst. 

The player can speed up or slow down the balls, or control their height, to make it easy to avoid these hazards. If all four balls have been punctured, the player loses a life. Once all ten balloons have been collected, the player is transported to the next environment, and when they have managed to get through all twelve environments, the player is transported back to the first environment.

        <desc>A more accurate title for this would be "Horace Goes Skiing, but only if he can brave a Frogger clone first", as you start the game by having to reach the ski shop to get skis, and then get back across to reach the slopes. The road is full of cars and bikes, contact with each of which costs $10 in ambulance fees out of your starting $40, and the skis themselves cost $10.

The actual skiing section has a pseudo-3D view, similar to a roving camera mounted above the course. Your task is to cut between the red and blue sets of flags, without hitting any of the trees on the course. Light contact with these will allow you to carry on; heavy contact breaks your skis and sends you back to the first section of the game (which you also return to after completing each of the courses).

        <name>How to be a Complete Bastard (128K)</name>
        <desc>This game is based around cult ‘alternative comedian’ Ade Edmondson’s book of the same name. Having gate-crashed a party full of sophisticated well-behaved types, you must do everything you can to be seen as hateful, yobbish and immature – a Complete Bastard.

The house has several rooms, each of which are filled with objects which are of use, as well as unlimited supplies of food, alcohol and coffee, which control how drunk you are at a time – some awful actions force you to be sober, others force you to be drunk. The game also displays whether you need the toilet (or, more accurately, any part of the house that would cause offence), whether you need to fart, and how strong-smelling these are.

The rooms can all be viewed from multiple angles, and 2 can be viewed at a time through a split-screen view.

To win, you need to prove to all 16 party guest that you are a complete bastard.

In this game, players control Kwon, dubbed the Human Killing Machine. He has vowed to demonstrate the power of his homeland; and does this by battling a series of opponents in several countries such as Moscow, Amsterdam, and Barcelona. HKM uses the term 'knockdown' for players who defeat their current opponent. Three knockdowns are needed for the player to move onto the next opponent.

Bonus points are awarded for the remaining energy Kwon has when he has successfully defeated his opponent. The player has five lives, and if all of them are used up, the game is over.

All fans jumped on his back and began to embrace, to kiss, to clear the clothes to him... just a little bit and had been the first film actor  attacked in public.

Humphrey finished in hospital with all kind of contusions and a nervous crisis that him left postrated in the bed during several months. When he recovered, he changed of house with the intention to obtain some privacy and to avoid that they took place more incidents like the one than took to the hospital.

But it seems that our friend was nothing lucky. The decorator had painted all the rooms with different colors that Humphrey had chosen and that caused certain alteration in his deranged nervous system.

        <desc>Victor Hugo never could have expected that his creation Quasimodo, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, would run such an obstacle course as is dished up in this game, dodging fireballs and arrows while leaping over pits and pikemen, sometimes with the help of a swinging bell-pull rope, in hopes of rescuing his beloved Esmeralda from the top tower -- all while being slow-but-steady chased across the castle parapets by an invincible knight in full armour.  Once you get the hang of any individual obstacle, the game starts throwing them at you in tandem, until toward the end you're tracking the swing of the rope, the thrust of the lance, the approach of the arrow and the advance of the knight all simultaneously!  Succeed, against all odds, and you get to do it again, but faster!  Even an able-bodied protagonist would have a hard time juggling all these threats, but I have a feeling a dedicated player with patience and good timing can overcome them.  Let's call it a hunch.

        <name>Hunchback II - Quasimodo's Revenge (48K)</name>
        <desc>The archetype of the Hunchback of Notre Dame really isn't terribly nuanced: he jumps around towers, ringing bells, rescuing Esmeralda and being generally physically unattractive.  Here he does all of these things, in a more platform-oriented take than the original, clambering up dangling ropes as they rise and fall, avoiding environmental threats such as rabid bats, thrown hatchets and enormous grinding clockwork gears all in the pursuit of small bells strewn across each screen's platforms.  Gathering all the bells permits you to advance higher up the tower, at the top of which the damsel in distress awaits your homely visage.

        <desc>Jorund, king of the Vikings, and father of our protagonist, has fallen for the deceits of Loki, Viking God of the lie. This deceit had as consequence the confinement of Jorund in the kingdom of Lukx, from where nobody has ever returned.

Because of this deceit the Viking king has profaned the prohibited garden of the Norns. In there are found a great part of the treasure that the Gods keep jealous, as well as some of the nymphs more beautiful than ever a human eye has contemplated.

Before such attractiveness, Jorund fell for the deceit of Loki and profaned the garden. The wrath of the Gods fell on him and their punishment did not take long: they would border to him to perpetuity to the kingdom of Lukx, where their inhabitants would give good account of the bones of our protagonist.

But Hundra was not resigned to that her father died in that exile, and therefore, could not reach Valhalla, paradise of the viking warriors.

Decided to change the fate of her father, she went to the Viking Mount Olympus where she convinced the Gods that her father had been deceived. They admitted their mistake, and saw that the punishment had been excessive; but their decisions were irrevocable and there was no way to save Jorund from his terrible end. Hundra offered to go to the kingdom of Lukx, and gather three sacred gems, stolen a long time ago from the Gods, to rescue her father.

        <desc>If being the best speedboat racer in the world were all there was to life, you'd live on easy street.  But when the government of Hydra has asked for your help in defeating Hydra's enemies by couriering parts to a secret weapon, and those enemies know you're coming... well then, life gets interesting.

Race down narrow swamp lanes to deliver parts of a secret weapon to bases at the finish of each section.  Enemies will be shooting at you, but you can shoot back with Uzi Cannons and Nukes.  Collect crystals along the way to boost your speed or shields.

        <desc>After his improbable success in Sweevo's World, the world's least capable robot is back, and must go to the heavily-polluted Deathbowl and clean it up. The Deathbowl's four plugs must be removed, in order, so as to drain the poisonous water and allow it to be refilled. 

The specific objects required to clear each plug must be obtained, in many cases by shooting the enemies who hold them - a task made harder by the fact that contact with them is fatal, you start without weaponry, and no weapon has unlimited ammunition. Whirlpools and bubbles must be used to reach the various areas of the Deathbowl. Contact with water causes Sweevo to start rusting, although oil can be picked up to limit the effect. The game is viewed isometrically, and features over 200 screens of action and puzzles (more in 128K mode).

        <desc>Six tough events await in this joystick-waggling action game. The full sequence of events is - swimming, skeet shooting, gymnastics, archery, triple jumping and weightlifting. You must complete each event in order to be allowed onto the next one.

Swimming involves moving left and right as fast as possible, while pressing fire when a breath is required. Skeet shooting and archery both come down to timing - though elevation and wind factors affect the latter. Gymnastics involves timing a succession of presses to ensure that the jump is long and the landing graceful. The triple jump involves one press for each part of the jump, whereas the weightlifting involves merely brute strength.

        <desc>A fanatical sect has changed mankind's future by summoning a previously extinct primeval entity in our past. You, a sole survivor of the once elite 'time corps' have been chosen by the federation of law and order to combat the entity in three time zones: Ancient Greece, Dark Ages and Space.

The game, controlled by joystick, has you moving the time warrior in horizontal-scrolling parallax levels.
You have to collect nine pieces that assemble to a face of the primeval entity who must be battled.

Meanwhile, the locals in each time zone do not like time warriors and throw and fire everything at you. Luckily, you are carrying an energy conversion kit that changes some shot objects and enemies into valuable weapons and armoury.
Good luck, you will need it!

Nick traces his 'wheels' to the remote Ice Temple and discovers that, far from being the innocent entertainment centre it claims, the building is a thermionic reactor being controlled by aliens to remove the planet's energy.

The whole planet is cooling down at such a rapid rate that it is turning into an icy waste and the Aliens are using the energy to fuel rocket warships destined to conquer the Earth.

In order to destroy the dastardly plan Nick must remove all eight pieces of the reactor and dump them down the refuse-crusher chutes.  It's not going to be easy and will use all Nick's past working experience but Nick is mankind's only hope!

        <desc>Players control a cock who is making sure that his wife delivers at least one of her children into the world. The cock automatically goes into the back room to mate with his wife, who lays an egg shortly afterwards. After this, it is up to the player to make sure that there is at least one egg among the two rows of nests, and that the egg is not destroyed by snakes, rats, raccoons, porcupines, and the like that are smart enough to climb the ladders leading up to the nests. 

The creatures enter the henhouse from either side, and must be moved along by pecking at them. As the cock walks around the henhouse, its energy will decrease. It must be replenished by eating chicken feed at both sides of the henhouse. Only then will the cock move faster.

Upon entering the back room, the player must wait until one or more hearts appear at the top of the screen, as they indicate the number of eggs the mother will lay. Since there are ten nests, up to ten hearts can only appear at a give time.

When an egg sits in the nest long enough, a egg will hatch out, and the resulting chick will make its way toward the back room, ring the bell outside the door, then go on in. If one of the creatures destroy an egg, or the only egg in the nest hatches out, the player loses a life, and the game is over when all lives are lost.

The ball bounces on the spot as standard, but can be directed to move, or bounce higher to gain momentum. Your task is to land on every cylinder in the level, so as to squash them down to ground level. Lots of spikes protrude in the levels, which must be avoided. Magic rings are both friend and foe - the first contact increases your remaining time, but a further contact loses a life. Other obstacles cause the ball to rebound, which could be good or bad depending on the situation.

        <desc>Monty Mole has been living in luxury since his previous adventures, but he has now been beamed up by an alien race who want him to do a job for them. Monty must trek through five worlds to retrieve the sacred scrolls of the race's Guardians. 

As with Core's previous hit Rick Dangerous 2 there is versatility in the exact structure of the game. The first four consist of the Orient, a Klondike mine, an Ice world and an Amazon forest - once these are completed the final world is open to you.

The platform-based gameplay is similar to Monty's earlier games, with primarily horizontal progresses as well as ropes and ladders to navigate. Monty has developed a useful flying kick, and has been given a smart bomb, with the potential to collect extra bombs and guns. Hazards, enemies and level designs are themed around each level, and range from cable cars and falling snowballs to Ninjas and Monkeys.

        <desc>Sid the Fireman's life is ruined when he falls into a shrinking machine, whilst dealing with a fire at a shrinking factory. To return to his full glory, he must find five parts of a stretching machine.

The end result is a side-view arcade adventure, in which obstacles must be used to clear paths to obtain all five parts. Many screens have multiple exits, which are not always obvious. Ghosts and ghouls  on fixed patterns must be avoided.

        <desc>The Incredible Shrinking Sphere of the title comes under your control in this isometric maze game which has similarities to Marble Madness and Spindizzy. The ball needs to be guided from the start of a level to the end, through 4 linked sections.

Various functioning squares must be used to your advantage. Uniquely these include changes to the ball's size, as well as it's physics. Revolving squares randomly fire the ball off in another direction, and ramps shoot you in the current direction at high speed. Weapons can be collected, as can shields - both of which are required to avoid some of the hazards on show. Black holes are always fatal however.

        <desc>Being an action title, the game starts off where Indy is about to have an excuse to use his trusty whip: in Monte Carlo, after he recruited headstrong former student Sophie to his aid and determined the location of ancient discs needed to open the door to the lost city of Atlantis. Most action takes place in isometric view, although there are some variations along the way to keep up interest. There are even some adventure-game elements, such as Indy's inventory which you can fill with various objects to use (i.e. money to buy things). They are mostly easy though, and are there only to relieve the tension from knuckle-blistering action.

        <desc>As in the movie (and the more famous graphic adventure), your task is to find the Holy Grail. Before this can be done you must find the Cross of Coronado, a shield and a diary. 

This makes for a four-level arcade adventure combining climbs, exploration (with several routes through each level, and some traps) and puzzles. Indy is armed with his trusty whip to fight off foes, but can also get involved in hand-to-hand combat. The first level takes place in caves underneath Colorado, before you reach a moving circus train strewn with traps, a Zeppelin which is full of guards and ladders, and then Castle Grunwald in Austria.

        <desc>The computer versions of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom are conversions of the Atari arcade game based on the second movie in the series. As Indy you must complete several cycles of the following 3 types of levels:Mine level: Whip your way through a mine in order to free children that are held captive. Use your whip to swing across chasms, climb ladders, ride along conveyor belts and defend yourself against attacks from Thuggee guards, bats, snakes and the fireball-throwing Mola ram. Escape with the mine cart after you've freed all children.
2. Mine cart level: Pick the right route through a network of tracks while riding in a mine cart. Avoid potholes, broken tracks &amp; guards in carts and safely reach the end of the track.
3. Temple level: Make your way to the altar and grab the Sankara stone while Mola Ram, bats and Thuggee guards attack you. Watch out for that lava.
With every cycle the mine &amp; mine cart levels become more complex, the layout of the temple levels is always the same. After several cycles there's a showdown with Mola Ram on the rope bridge.

There are walls around the pitch, off which the ball ricochets in play, and 5 players on each team. There are no dead-ball plays other than centres and penalties. 3 skill levels are available, as are 2-player games. Off-the-ball fighting is a common feature of the game, which can lead to penalties being awarded.

There are some sub-games too, involving your karate-master holding a shield and defending himself against bouncing balls from both directions, and kicking bombs off the screen before they explode.

All in the pursuit of that elusive black belt...

        <desc>Pandora's first game combines the Gauntlet style with the World War 2 setting, and specifically the Eagle's Nest building which is being used by a commander as his HQ. Three Allied soldiers have been captured, and you must infiltrate the facilities, rescue your brave comrades, destroy the building, and salvage as much of the stolen art treasures as possible.

There are eight levels to explore, each with a specific mission objective. Some of the paintings are loose, others are in crates which must first be shot. Explosives must be collected, not shot. With limited ammunition, guards everywhere, keys at a premium, and lots of strategic hiding points, an all-guns-blazing approach is less successful than a planned, measured one.

        <desc>Invasion Force is a fixed screen shoot 'em up where the player, as so often before, has to defend the earth from an army of hostile aliens. The player moves his laser base along the bottom of the screen. At the top there's a large enemy ship that is protected by a moving force field. In addition to this there are smaller ships that drops bombs towards the player. The objective of each level is simply to destroy the large ship, but to be able to reach and damage it the player first has to shoot holes in the force field. Hitting the force field causes the missiles to ricochet back towards the player. The force field also has black parts that should be avoided, since hitting them will fully repair the enemy ship. To take down the enemy ship the player has to hit the control area located in the centre of the ship. The game is over when the player has lost all of his three ships or when the time runs out.</desc>

        <name>Ivan 'Ironman' Stewart's Super Off Road Racer (128K)</name>
        <desc>Enter the world of off-road racing as 4 vehicles will face each other, on a series of tracks which are based around flipped and reversed versions of a core selection. Fame, glory and bikini clad women await your victories and the taste of dirt awaits if you fail. Let a computer car beat you and you lose one of your 3 credits.

Successful races bring more money, which can be used to soup up their machine. Boosts to top speed, grip and acceleration can be purchased, and your nitro boost must be kept topped up. If you are desperate for upgrades, you can buy into your spare credits

Only your off-road driving abilities will be enough to pull you to first place in these races. Play alone or with up to 3 other players (depending on the version)  in this conversion of a classic arcade game.

        <name>Jack the Nipper (48K)</name>
        <desc>Jack the Nipper is a platform game that contains 50 screens packed with action.

Jack is an evil and wicked toddler. You play Jack and you have to cause as much trouble without being penalized for it. To see how naughty you've been there is a naughtyometer at the bottom of the screen.

To cause some mayhem Jack must jump on things, pick up objects and drop those at places where they cause the most trouble to grown-ups.

The various objects can be found all over town and at Jack's home.
The game starts at Jack's home but Jack can walk out the door and go into town to, for example, blow up the police station, kill all flowers or free prisoners. Try to get a credit card and do some serious shopping!

The first thing you should look for is you peashooter and fire peas at various objects or persons. Toot your horn to frustrate grown-ups or animals.

The naughtier your the higher your naughtyometer goes up!
The game comes to an end as the naughtyometer reaches 100%.
Cause as much trouble as you can... but don't get spanked for it by grown-ups!

        <name>Jack the Nipper II - In Coconut Capers (48K)</name>
        <desc>Naughty toddler Jack finds himself in Africa, with the aim of progressing through 192 screens of platform action. He starts with nine lives but no weapons, although a supply of coconuts to lob is close at hand. 

The jungle is full of snakes, rhinos, birds and all manner of other creatures, all of which must be avoided or killed - remember that their attack paths are pre-programmed, and the trajectory of your coconuts is quite limited. Travelling through the levels involves, amongst other things, ladders, mine carts, trees, ropes and logs.

As well as simply completing the game and amassing as many points as possible, you can aim to be as naughty as possible, which is gauged by a 'Naughty-O-Meter' next to the score, with numerous objects available for that purpose (one can be carried at a time, alongside one weapon).

        <desc>The enemy army has captured too many of your forces. Being held in P.O.W. camps, these soldiers are effectively out of the war... unless some kind of rescue operation can be mounted. Heavy Forces are too slow and visible to be of any use, but perhaps something smaller and lighter may make it in where larger forces would fail. A small jeep, maybe two, crewed by about 4 people.... minimal enough not to represent too much of a loss and yet suitable enough to aid in rescue. But of course, if these brave men want to succeed AND come back alive; they'll need to fight like animals... they'll need to fight like jackals...

Jackal is an overhead view jeep game for up to 2 players. The controller moves in four directions, button A fires your gernades (upgradable to bazooka) and button B your machine gun which ALWAYS fires to the top of the screen. Your mission is to locate facilities where soldiers are being held prisoner, rescue as many as possible, and escort them to a safe landing zone where they will be air transported away. After that, you'll need to fight a boss battle against the enemy to progress.

As a policeman, the object of the game is to fire on escaped convicts who have taken the warden hostage, and in order to do this, you must make your way through downtown streets, a park, a bridge, and eventually, a prison. By rescuing hostages along the way, you can obtain a number of weapons, such as a pistol and a tear gas gun, and you can select them by using the weapons select area at the bottom of the screen. Be careful: If you shoot any hostages, you will lose whatever weapons that you have.

        <desc>Jasper the mouse must face 22 screens in this platform puzzler. Tonnes of objects are placed throughout the game, and each has a specific use. You select these using the 1-5 number keys, which tells you that only 5 objects can be carried at a time, which makes for a certain degree of backtracking. The screens are full of adversaries like cats, spiders and wasps, all of which must be avoided, as contact loses you a life. Methodical planning of your route before you start, and inch-perfect timing and key-pressing once you do, are essential for progress - charging in headlong is unlikely to produce anything but a dead mouse (and a dead keyboard after you hit it)

        <desc>As Amity Island's Police Chief Brodie, it is your responsibility to stop the lethal shark Jaws from killing the residents and tourists. The Mayor is keeping an eye on you, and wants the job done as quickly and cheaply as possible.

Unfortunately, the main weapon which must be used to finally kill Jaws has been broken into four pieces, which are located along the sea bed in different places. As you explore the 150-plus screens of the game, you must shoot the other fish - some can be shot using your standard weapon, while others (those which flash) must be shot using special limited bullets.

You also have responsibility for closing beaches, which removes the risk of a shark attack, but also costs the area business, especially on hot days, and irritates the Mayor.

        <name>Jet Set Willy (48K)</name>
        <desc>Cult hero Matthew Smith followed up Manic Miner with a seminal platform game. Having struck it lucky in the first game, Willy now owns a lavish mansion with over 60 rooms linked in a 3D plane, and must tidy it all before his housekeeper will let him sleep.

Each room has its own hazards, such as spikes, revolving razors and ropes. The route through the house must be navigated carefully, due to the multiple entrances to some rooms - this is perhaps the first action game where mapping is an advantage. Another innovation, to the chagrin of players everywhere, is manual protection - a sheet of colour-coded numbers.

        <desc>Jetman has crash-landed on a distant planet, with ledges suspended in mid-air and populated by various nasties, and he must escape and find his way home. Your first task is to retrieve each of the three parts of his spaceship, in order, and carry them over the base part. After this, you must collect enough fuel to be able to fly away, again by picking it up and dropping it over the ship (you don't have to actually make contact with the ship in doing this). Once you've filled the ship up, you can fly on to the next level, in which you must again refuel.

Each level contains various bad guys, with different attack patterns; you have a lazer to shoot them for points, and must avoid contact with them. Diamonds can be collected for bonus points, and you get an extra life after every 10,000 points.

        <name>Jetsons The Computer Game (128K)</name>
        <desc>The famous animated TV series by Hanna-Barbera spawned a film, and ultimately this licensed game, which contains 8 levels alternating between side-scrolling dodge-and-manipulate and driving gameplay. All four members of the Jetson family have a themed level.

The driving sections take place within George's Jetcar, and you must slow down for the speed-limited areas and beware of black holes.

At the beginning of the game you are George Jetson, labourer of the Spacely Space Sprockets company in 2062. Your boss Mr. Spacely wants you to work, but you want to collect money and have a fun. So after the boss ordinary order you can explore the company as usually, collect money bills and useful items, avoiding dangerous robotic mechanisms and Mr. Spacely himself. 

On further levels, other Jetsons family members must do the same things, but at their own locations. Level 2 involves taking Jane out of her booby-trapped home, level 3 sees Judy trying to get a kiss form pop heartthrob Jet Screamer, and finally Elroy is locked in at school and has to escape.

You have to activate the items hidden behind the hatches with buttons. These allow you to progress on level, for example, fix an elevator with wrench. Time presses and you have to complete your mission quickly.

        <desc>Tough guy Joe Blade must rescue six respected leaders from the madcap Crax Bloodfinger, who has kidnapped them in different areas of his base. Along the way he will find six bombs which must be activated, leaving him with only 20 minutes to rescue everyone.

Joe Blade is viewed side-on and uses flick-screen progression. The bombs are deactivated by arranging letters into alphabetical order, but the bulk of the gameplay involves shooting and maze navigation. The screens are linked in various ways, and contain a number of keys which must be used correctly.

        <name>Joe Blade II (128K)</name>
        <desc>As Players Software correctly predicted, London in 1995 is an unfriendly unsafe city ran by thugs. Innocent civilians who leave the house will almost certainly face violence. An acclaimed hero since his successes in the original, Joe Blade is the man to put things right - if he can kill 100 thugs and rescue 20 civilians within ten minutes, the thugs will retreat and the city will be saved.

As Joe, you must move through the streets and kill these thugs, by kicking them in the head (they have body armour). As in the first game, the streets are flick-screen and have many doorways linking them. Rescuing civilians involves touching them before completing a sub-game within a minute.

There are four subgame variants of increasing difficulty, all based around a 1-2-3-4 sequence of numbers. The first involves simply stopping the cursor as each one appears in order - pressing the wrong one sends you back to having to find a 1. In the second, the numbers are on screen in random order, a cursor cycling through them - press fire to swap the two numbers currently highlighted. In the third, you are presented with two jumbled sets and must put one of them in order, by swapping numbers across the two sets. In the fourth, you must form the sequence by swapping an ever-changing number into the right place, by pressing fire at the right moment.

Once the dynamite has been collected, the player makes their way toward the left edge of each level where they have to crash into the castle gate in order to rescue the hostages trapped inside. Another plane takes the place of the damaged one, and the players uses this plane to take the hostages back to base. The plane can only carry two hostages, so return trips to the castle are usually required. Once all hostages in the level have been returned to base, the player proceeds to the next level.

You have to fight your way through various guards and large dogs using your sword as well as kicks and forward-rolls. You must also go through several particle beams which block your path by collecting shields matching the colour of the beams. After usage the shield becomes exhausted and you must collect another one to advance. Other items such as a pipe wrench and wire-cutters can be collected to aid your progress.

The documents are located in a safe which you must open by entering the code. Once in possession of the documents you must get to the roof and make your escape via helicopter to complete the mission.</desc>

        <desc>Kick Off was the first football game of its kind, having a top down view and unlike other football games of that time the ball was not glued to the feet of the players. Playing Kick Off requires skills in boll control. There is an option to learn these skills without being harassed by the opposition. The set pieces like corner kicks, passing, sliding tackles and dribbling can be practiced to perfection. Each player on the pitch has a unique combination of 4 attributes, namely Pace, Stamina, Accuracy and Aggression. As you progress you will need to adapt to to different types of players. You can play in a league consisting of 8 teams. The teams in the league are on the whole evenly matched but have different styles of play with players attribute to match that style. There is 12 different referees in the game.

        <name>Kick Off 2 (128K)</name>
        <desc>The original Kick Off was expanded on in many ways for this sequel. The game now features full tournament modes (although the players on the teams are fictitious) and four different pitches (including an implementation of plastic pitches, whose uneven bounce cause controversy when several British clubs tried them in the 1980s).

Viewed top-down, the controls involve trapping the ball under your foot, giving you time to prepare passes. Running with the ball is tricky at first, as it doesn't stick to your foot the way it did in contemporary football games. Complex moves such as overhead kicks, back-heels and long-range through-ball passes can be completed with practice.

        <desc>Based around the Kikstart TV show, the game allows you to recreate all those death-defying stunts in the comparative safety of your home.  Viewed from the side, there are many hazards to avoid along the way. Some of these include steps to jump over, tyres and hedges to plough through at maximum speed, and mud which will slow you down.

24 courses are built in, and you can choose a set of 5 of these to race at a time, or let the computer choose them at random. More importantly, a course designer allowing you to create one of your own is included, with full control of the placement of the many hazards..

        <desc>Kinetik is an arcade adventure which features gravity, inertia and other real physics heavily. You control a round spaceship, which must be guided through the 44+ screens. Collect the letters P,A and X in that order and reach the end to win.

There are foes to avoid or shoot – some take objects you have but most merely drain some of your energy. Some walls can also be shot out. Some rooms have white spots which affect gravity and drag you inwards.

Avoid contact with red walls as these drain energy; all others are harmless. There are teleporters to help you navigate the game, and power-ups which remove the complex physics.

        <desc>Our hero must reach Melkhior, a somewhat eccentric wizard who is the only one who can save him. As with most Ultimate titles of the day, reaching him is a long and treacherous challenge, involving both puzzle-solving and action, meaning that each screen requires thorough planning and precise navigation. 

The game uses the isometric viewpoint in a manner similar to the later Head Over Heels, using monochrome but detailed graphics and techniques to avoid flickering sprites. The game lasts for 40 days and nights - at night your character turns into a werewolf. Ultimate's individual style of eschewing straightforward instuctions in favour of feature lists and riddles is put to good use here, with the story detailed in a rhyming poem of sorts.

        <desc>After rescuing the wizard Gimbal, the Magic Knight finds himself transported into the 25th century aboard the peaceful trade starship USS Pisces. He must find a way back to his own time.

Knight Tyme is the third game of the Magic Knight series. As in Spellbound, the previous game, the player interacts with the environment through the "Windimation" system: pressing a button brings up a window with a list of commands (pick up/drop/take/give an object, examine, command a character, read something, cast a spell and wear/unwear object). The player can scroll through these with the movement keys, and execute them with the same button used before. Spaceflight is part of the gameplay as the ship must visit several different planets. The spaceship has to be refueled, otherwise the character will be stuck forever in space. There are rooms that kill the knight instantaneously. Usually there is a puzzle associated with these rooms that must be solved in order to access them.

Kong sits at the top right of the screen with the aforementioned damsel who occasionally shouts 'Help' in text. You're at the bottom left of the screen and to rescue the maiden you must traverse a series of inclined girders and ladders.

Just to make it interesting, Kong sees you and starts rolling barrels and other obstacles down the girders towards you. These must be avoided by jumping over them, or smashing them with a hammer. There are 4 screens to complete and points are scored for smashing barrels, collecting gems, and completing screens.

In the first part, the player must climb to the top of five buildings and must defeat one of Kong's minions on each one. Throughout the level, the player must avoid barrels and fire balls, and activate levers to move platforms. 

The second part, which can only be accessed when the first one is completed, is a simple side-scrolling run 'n' gun game. While still avoiding barrels and other objects, the player must shoot at enemies. Finally, they have to defeat Kong and save the girl.

There are a number of types of special bricks, but unlike e.g. Arkanoid, they do not fall towards the bat. Instead, when you hit a special brick, it flips to show a letter. E.g. E (Extend bat), C (Catch ball), M (Missile), B (Bomb, explodes when hit by ball, clearing a number of bricks) and X (Extra life).

The enemies/obstacles are more varied than in Arkanoid. Some make the bat freeze, some actually chew and eat your ball and spit out the core back at you!

Mr. X has captured the pickpocket Sylvia and it is up to Thomas, a kung-fu master who owns a restaurant, to get her back. She is located on the top floor of Mr. X's castle and Thomas will need to fight his way to the top. Of course, this won't be easy as each floor has many opponents to get past and a floor boss at the end of each level. 

Thomas is able to move left and right, jump, duck, and punch and kick. Enemy projectiles such as knives can be kicked in the air to rebound them towards the enemy. On the top floor resides Mr. X himself.

        <name>Laser Squad (48K)</name>
        <desc>Laser Squad is by the same designer as Microprose's classic X-Com: UFO Defense. It brings to the table an immersive gameplay environment as well as many innovative ideas that weren't available in any other game of the time.

In Laser Squad you control a group of "marine"-like soldiers (and the occasional cyborg). Before taking them into battle, you must buy them weapons and armour with a predetermined amount of credits, taking into account the individual abilities of your squad. Unlike X-COM, the soldiers do not gain experience over time.

There are 3 missions in turn - in The Assassins you must face down Sterner Regnix and his guards, Moonbase assault challenges you to destroy the OmniCorp database, and Rescue From the Mines eschews violence in favour of a rescue mission. These are viewed from above and progress in turns. Laser Squad also features a 2-player "hotseat"-type gaming option.

        <name>Laser Zone (48K)</name>
        <desc>One of Jeff Minter's early eighties shoot'em'ups in his typical frantical style, Laser Zone has you controlling not one, but two "zone gunners" in a constrained playfield. Controlled with only one joystick, you move one zone gunner on a vertical wall and one at the bottom. Wave upon wave of nasties come into the zone, and must be shot down before they reach either wall, where neither gun can reach them and they advance toward you. You can try to escape perpetually, since your movements wrap around the screen borders, at least until another enemy has reached your wall, but it is better to use up one of your electro bolts that will erase everything on the screen.

        <desc>Last Duel follows the story of two planets that are in war with each other. On the planet Bacula, the Galden Tribe has overthrown the government and seized power over the whole world. Now they want more – by invading the peaceful planet of Mu and kidnapped Queen Sheets.

The Mu-ans decided to take action. They asked their best scientists to come up with a weapon that will defeat the Galdens. After many long months, they were able to develop a vehicle of immense firepower, capable of leaping into the air to avoid ground hazards. In addition to that, it can transform into an airborne vessel whose purpose is to eliminate any kind of enemy in the sky.

Players have to guide their vehicle through six difficult levels - alternating between ground vehicle and fighter plane – while destroying every Galden that gets in their way. While progressing, holes in the ground need to be avoided, as players lose one of their ships should they happen to fall through one. Shooting power pods scattered around the level allows the player to increase their firepower. However, they lose that firepower if one of their ships is destroyed.

        <name>Last Ninja 2 - Back with a Vengeance (128K)</name>
        <desc>With the scrolls now in his possession, The Last Ninja begins training a new order of Ninja. During a training session he is mysteriously transported to XXth-century New York. The Evil Shogun has returned! Torn from his own time, The Last Ninja must defend himself once more with nothing more than the belief in his own abilities. 

Last Ninja 2: Back with a Vengeance is an action/adventure game where the player, controlling a powerful ninja, must fight his way through opponents while collecting necessary items. The game is split into various levels, each of them depicting a different locale and divided into several screens. The view is isometric and the ninja can move in four different dimensions (he can also walk backwards) and jump. 

Enemies, armed with fists and various ninja weapons, wander around the levels. The ninja must fight them either bare-handed or with the weaponry he finds along the way; in either case, he has a number of blows and attacks at his disposal, as well as the ability to block. There's a special weapon, shuriken, which are thrown in a straight line rather than used for melee combat; if they strike an enemy, they'll instantly kill or at least heavily damage him. 

There are items scattered around the levels, such as keys, rope, a map or hamburgers (which restore health when eaten). Collecting these items and using them in a proper place is necessary for completing the game.

        <desc>By 2011, the only way to travel at top speed is on skyways build high above the ground. These become popular with boy-racers and general speed freaks pretty soon, and that's why you're aiming to hurtle across them in this arcade conversion.

The road scrolls vertically, with some moderately sharp bends in a manner similar to Spy Hunter You have a jump device to clear the many jumps,  or to land onto and flatten the other maniacs who line the road. You must choose which path to follow at OutRun-style forks in the road. 

The roads contain bonus tags including bonus points, a battering ram to make contact with other cars more effective, and energy boosts to replenish damage. If you leave the road you must replace your car onto it using a directable winch which appears at the appropriate point.

Armed only with a sword and 'star knives', you must fight your way through countless henchmen and the occasional boss to complete your task.  Levels include the forest, moat, inside and outside of the castle.  These levels repeat as the seasons change.  The gameplay is side scrolling.  Kage's moves include the ability jump extremely high in the air, grab and climb trees, block and attack with his sword, and throw shuriken.  The game can be challenging at times though because the player dies in one hit.  2-players are supported, but must take turns.

These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.

As you've captured the Rapier machine gun your enemy have been developing, there are plenty who can't bear to see the back of you unless it's bloodied and lifeless.

The game's 8 levels feature quite a variety of settings, vehicles and situations. You will have to evade fire from snipers based in windows, enemy jets, helicopters and well-trained marines, while riding tanks and speedboats as well as being on foot. The levels are set in locations such as the enemy camp, the jungle, a ruined city and the final flight back to your base.

This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.

        <desc>The Bungeling Empire has stolen a huge cache of gold from its rightful owners, and your mission is to infiltrate its treasury and recapture it. This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes.

The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.

        <desc>Lorna is the typical sexy heroine who fights against the foreign aliens in a distant place.

        <desc>The first time I came to this village and met its inhabitants, I realized that something strange was haunting their minds. That evening, the air was so cold that I could even feel it inside my bones. Everybody began to return to their homes, locking their doors tight for the night, hoping not be surprised defenseless against their most horrifying terrors.

It seemed that these people had no soul, that they had turned away from God, abandoned themselves to superstition.

I tried hard to forget that feeling, but my partner could not. He was younger and not yet mastered his terrors. However, my main concern was to find a place to spend the night. I wasn't worried about monsters nor demons, but the cold: another night sleeping rough and my bones would be rankling all the way to Santiago.</desc>

        <desc>Unfortunately, it seems like the crudely assembled multi-stage rocket that Jetman created in his first video-game outing (Jetpac) could have been put together a little better. With the rocket disintegrating about him in warp space, Jetman manages to crash land on a previously undiscovered planet, inhabited by hundreds of aliens intent of the total destruction of Earth. Oh no! Save us, Jetman!

Lunar Jetman has a graphical feel to it that is very similar to the original Jetpac game, but the gameplay is quite a bit different. Jetman's jetpac this time only has limited fuel, and that can prove hazardous when those pesky aliens come looking for him. Fortunately, Jetman also has a lunar rover at his disposal. Inside this he can replenish his jetpac's fuel supply as well as travel unmolested about the planet's surface. Unfortunately, the lunar rover can only travel across flat land, so the player must find and set down bridging units to allow the rover to traverse over any craters blocking the way.

Blocking the way to what, you ask? Well, each level has an alien base somewhere. Jetman must locate a bomb (which can be carried on the back of the rover), take it to the base and destroy it before the level's timer runs out. Taking too long results in missiles being launched to destroy the Earth and Jetman himself.

The game contains multiple levels, each obviously more hazardous and tricky than the last, and the player continues playing, racking up points until he runs out of lives.

        <desc>The feel of a gangster movie is recreated isometrically in this game. You play a private detective who has the task of retrieving a vital cassette from a Mob boss' hideout. Two twin girls are in the area - one is on your side, the other is connected to the mob. Needless to say, you will have to work out who you can trust.

You control the detective with either directional (key or joystick press corresponds to motion) or rotational (forward to move, left or right to rotate) control. Pressing fire activates the main command menu, which allows you to pick up or drop objects, use your gun, and communicate with people. You can carry 3 items at a time; a command exists to swap between them.

        <name>Mad Mix 2 - En el Castillo de los Fantasmas (Spanish) (128K)</name>
        <desc>Peace had arrived finally at "Cocovillage" thanks to the good work made by Mad Mix, who had become the worthy successor of his grandfather. But the nightmare had still not finished, because a few miles away, in the town of his cousin Ope, "Cococastle" (a place crowned by a phantasmagoric Castle), it was happening a strange phenomena. All the indications made think that a "coco", survivor of "Cocovillage", had converted the Castle into his dwelling, establishing in addition a maleficent alliance with the sinister inhabitants from that place. The terror had seized the inhabitants of "Cococastle", and only Mad can give back the tranquillity to the pacific inhabitants of this village.

The game consists in eating all the "coconuts" (small ball species that are dispersed through all the Castle) which appear at every moment. Once you have finished with all the coconuts of the level you will pass to the following stay of the Castle of the Ghosts, this is the mechanic until you have been able to explore all its corners. However, you shouldn't care only in eating all the "coconuts", but in addition you will have to be very kind trying to not collide with any of the inhabitants of the terrific Castle, as well as to avoid the different traps (or using them in your own benefit) while taking helpful -some with really curious effects- objects.

        <desc>Mad Mix is a Pac-Man variant, with a typical bird's eye view for each level and pellets you must eat in order to get to the next stages. Navigate the maze you're trapped in and gobble up food while trying to avoid the ghosts that are chasing you.

As a Pac-Man variant, there are some changes made to distinguish itself. Some levels offer transformative powers. These include being turned into a hippopotamus - which allows you to step on ghosts - and a vacuum cleaner - to clean up pellets corrupted by a wandering enemy. On some levels, you can also briefly turn the protagonist into a spaceship or a tank, where you can shoot ghosts from a fixed vantage point.

As with most arcade titles at the time, there is no true ending; the game loops back to the first level when you finish the last one.

While searching for the lamp, he must avoid many hazards such as bouncing boulders, deadly portcullises, moving walls, vampire bats, and a treacherous elevator. If Aladdin makes contact with these hazards, he falls off his magic carpet and is returned to the start of the cave. Once he has made his way to the third cave, he must find some way to get the lamp, which is guarded by a huge fire-breathing dragon. When he has this, Aladdin goes back to the first cave to get another magic lamp.

You play Cobra as he journeys vertically, taking out the mounted turrets and enemy cars as he goes. There are also colored turrets to shoot at - each colour represents a particular change to your car's performance (there are a few temporary negative ones alongside the upgrades). You have 16 smart bombs, which may sound generous, but just watch them go. A boss must be beaten at the end of each level.

The platform puzzle which first introduced Luigi to the world has both single and multiplayer action with two differing game types, but with the same objective.
Crabs, turtles and fighter flies must be cleared out by jumping underneath the platform they sit on, then kicking them away. Each level is cleared when a set number of coins is collected.

For the two player mode, the first to collect the set amount of coins wins.

        <name>Mask (48K-128K)</name>
        <desc>MASK is game based on a popular animated TV series of the mid 1980's. In addition to the TV series, entitled M.A.S.K., an acronymn for Mobile Armored Strike Kommand, there was also a series of books, authored by Kenneth Harper and illustrated by Bruce Hogarth, and comics. A new line of toys was produced to accompany each TV series.

The stories all centre around the M.A.S.K. organisation led by the fearless Matt Tracker. M.A.S.K. agents wear helmets or masks to protect their identities and to give them super powers which help in their fight against the criminal V.E.N.O.M. organisation. They drive super powered vehicles which can transform.
V.E.N.O.M., aka the Vicious Evil Network of Mayhem, are the bad guys. They are by Miles Mayhem one time friend of Matt and co-founder of MASK who betrayed Matt long ago. 

There are four areas to the game and in all Matt must drive his Thunderhawk vehicle around the game area, avoiding V.E.N.O.M.'s armoured vehicles and tanks while accomplishing tasks in a specific order.
In area 1 : Boulder Hill, his first task is to recover his own mask and later an abducted agent. However it's not just a case of driving around until the agent is found. Matt must first and collect a scanner which will direct him the missing agent (who will be hidden). However the agent cannot be picked up until his mask has been collected and the scanner will not function until the four pieces of the security key have been collected and assembled. Items, including bombs, are collected by driving over them. Bombs are Matt's only weapon against V.E.N.O.M.'s tanks and, as bombs do, they will damage Matt and his vehicle if he's too close to the explosion.

The remainder of the game consists of three more areas, Prehistoric, Far Future, and VENOM Base each of which have two abducted agents to rescue.

This is an adaption of the motion picture Masters of the Universe. You, as He-Man, must find the eight chords to the Cosmic Key. Along the way, you must fight Skeletor's minions. First, you fight in the streets and try to find a chord hidden in the streets. After you enter the scrapyard, you will meet and fight Blade and Karg to the death in a hand to hand beat 'em up to get another key. In Charlie's Electronics Store, you aim your cross-hair to shoot oncoming enemies who guard a chord. Later, make your way to the rooftops and fight a laser battle on a flying disk. After all eight chords are retrieved, go mano-a-mano with Skeletor in the final battle.

        <desc>The original Match Day was the first serious football game to hit the Spectrum, and this sequel emerged over 2 years later. League and Cup tournaments for up to 8 teams (any or all of which can be human-controlled) are offered alongside one-off Friendly matches with a handicap option - passcodes are given to allow you to restore these to the same state another day.

Matches are seven-a-side, with variable lengths from 10 to 30 minutes. All kicks except set pieces are variable in strength using a Kick-o-meter which is displayed on screen. One revolutionary feature of the game was the Diamond Deflection System, which mathematically calculated the angle and pace of any rebounds.

        <desc>There was a massive wave of football management games in 1992, and this was Zeppelin's contender. It was licensed around the BBC's football highlights programme famed for its classic theme music. The standard options exist (such as training, transfers and tactics) but the control system is unique. A diary is presented on the table, and you have to drag the icons for the activities you want to focus that amount of time on. This not only makes the presentation and style unusual, but also accurately represents the limited amount of time a real manager has.

You are armed, but so are the Outcasts you must face.

Hazards include walls, gaps in the road and oil slicks. A scanner at the bottom of the screen gives some advanced warning. You can pick up improved weaponry, extra fuel, and boxes of oil, which you can drop into the paths of onrushing bikes. As well as shooting other bikes, you can ram them into walls at the side of the road, or into the aforementioned hazards.

Imagine what fun it would be to explore - to boldly go where no boldly goer had boldly gone before - unless they happened to live there. 

Latest research from the Institute of Advanced Research (I.A.R.) indicated that there are quite a lot of planets with things living on them. Some of these things are pretty intelligent like us really. Other of these things are really stupid, like whelks, for example. 

Anyway, to cut a long story short, you have been selected to explore the universe, boldly seeking out strange and exciting new worlds. If you find any, your instructions are quite clear. 

BLAST THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS OUT OF THEM!!

        <desc>Mega Phoenix brings the concept of the earlier arcade game Phoenix into the 90s, to the extent that a coin-op version was later made by Gaelco. The game is a single-screen shoot ‘em up in which the player moves left to right while shooting several waves. There is a shield function available, which lasts for a short period of time (after which it must recharge to be used again) and it paralyses the craft while active.

The first waves consist of several small alien beings in a set pattern, which move down from the fleet towards the player at random intervals- contacts with these kills the player. Deadly phoenixes firing at you come next, followed by the Mega Phoenix itself and then a final boss, before it all repeats with higher difficulty.

        <desc>In the XXII century the universe is dominated by two major forces born after decades of major wars: the Empire and the Hark Federation. Being both of them expansionist governments, frictions in their borders are almost constant.

Within the Empire, the biggest power after the emperor himself, are the Mega Corporations, financial partnerships that control every aspect of people's lives. With power of life and death, these Mega-Corp, as they are familiarly known, extend their tentacles by the Cosmos in search of riches to extract or eventually snatch.

The federal system consists in the "adoption" under its tutelage of technologically poor planetary systems in general, although rich in material or manpower that are invariably employed in improving the resources of the originary Hark planets.

"Megacorp" is a conversational adventure with static graphics in which you will take part of the Imperial federation. Your exact mission would be guiding your operative agent to get control of the situation on the GEA-3 planet. You should, helping rebel groups, overthrow the government, now in the hands of The Federation.

Your craft will land on the forest surrounding the rebel base. Cross the lake, pass police checks and find your link to be identified by their status as merchant in fur, from here follow his instructions. The mission is risky but the reward is great, if you make GEA-3 planet be part of the Empire, you will get immensely rich.

        <name>Mega-Corp - Parte 2 (Spanish) (48K)</name>
        <desc>In the XXII century the universe is dominated by two major forces born after decades of major wars: the Empire and the Hark Federation. Being both of them expansionist governments, frictions in their borders are almost constant.

Within the Empire, the biggest power after the emperor himself, are the Mega Corporations, financial partnerships that control every aspect of people's lives. With power of life and death, these Mega-Corp, as they are familiarly known, extend their tentacles by the Cosmos in search of riches to extract or eventually snatch.

        <desc>Mercs is a shoot 'em up influenced by Ikari Warriors. You are an anti-terrorism soldier, and must rescue a former President from a Central African revolutionary gang. 

You run through each of the 8 levels, which primarily scroll horizontally, shooting everyone before they can shoot you. At times you will have to shoot trees and other scenery to progress. 

Finding strategic placings is important, especially as you can't shoot while on water. Most of the time you are on foot, but at times you can hijack vehicles of shot foes. There are improved weapons, smart bombs and energy recharges to collect. Each of the 8 levels ends with a large vehicle requiring multiple shots to destroy.

        <desc>General Ironside's Metal Army of thuggish louts has invaded a nuclear power station in Slough and are threatening to blow it up. As Joe Blade is busy (cross-references to other Players releases were common in their inlays), freelance heavy Harry Chainsaw is brought in to deactivate their bomb.

Gameplay is a fairly conventional platform shoot 'em up with maze elements. Your weapon is powerful enough to destroy Ironside's forces, but needs to be recharged regularly. Hazards to be avoided include laser bolts, falling crushers and gas and electric discharges.

Your objective is to drive around Miami, looking for red cars and shooting them away, within a time limit for each level. Avoid hitting buildings or other cars, and don't shoot too many civilian cars or you are history. If you drive erratically in the vicinity of other cop cars they will stop you, costing valuable time. You can use a map of the city to help you find your targets.

        <desc>The Ogre King and his minions have taken over Disney Castle, and it's Mickey's task to win it back. The game starts on a sequence of stairways, up which Mickey must move, shooting any creatures that get in his way. Eventually you will come to a door and go through it, at which point the second section of the game begins.

These are viewed from above, and see Mickey negotiate his way through a multi-screen maze, with multiple exits on each screen. Ghosts and ogres block his path, but he's armed with a water pistol for the former and an axe for the latter, both of which need replenishing regularly. Some doors require keys to move through.

There are several sub-games, including Pac-Man and Donkey Kong-derived games. To win the game you must finally beat the Ogre King.

The same movements and shots can be made, sometimes with even funnier effects (e.g. banana shot bouncing of the wall and into goal).

        <name>Mikie (48K)</name>
        <desc>Mikie puts you in charge of Mikie, a high school student who likes to win hearts of every girl that he can lay his eyes on. 

There are several classrooms to explore like the Quantum Physics Room, Locker Room, Canteen, the Aerobics Dancing Class, and the Playground. In each classroom, Mikie has to collect all the hearts that are found in each classroom to form a message. In order to collect these hearts, Mikie must stand somewhere near them and shout out. There are two type of hearts: small  and large. Mikie needs to shout out only once to collect the small hearts, and multiple times to collect the large ones. When a message is formed, Mikie can exit the classroom through a door marked OUT.

Stopping him from collecting the hearts is the teacher, the chef, and the janitor. The teacher is the worst one. When he is unable to  catch you, he works up a sweat, and eventually, throws his teeth at you. When his teeth hits Mikie, he loses one of his three lives. In later classrooms, Mikie can throw stuff at his enemies in order to stun them for several seconds (for instance, the basketballs in the locker room, and the chickens in the canteen). The janitor isn't as bad because he walks much slower than the others.

In between levels, you have to enter the next classroom through a door marked IN without being caught, but you can do at least two things to pass time: Steal some lunch, and open one of the unmarked doors to receive a punch, a kick, or the chance to see a naked lady with breasts. Beware that if you take too long in the hallway and don't travel between floors, a bucket slides across the screen real fast and attempt to slip you.

If you're good enough at the game, you can enter a high score, and if you fail to enter anything, the game will assume that you are Clint Eastwood.

        <desc>This is a 'Casino simulator' consisting of five games at which you can gamble your virtual money. The player starts with $10.000 and the object is to win as much money as possible at one of five gambling games. These games can be played in any order and, if the player's had enough of, say, poker then they can choose to stop and pay any other game. All the games are explained in the cassette inlay.

1 million dollar fruit machine - 
The easiest way to gamble, just press a key to spin the reels. Each spin costs $1,000.

Blackjack - 
Also known as 'Pontoon' and 'Vignt-et-un'. To win the face value of the players cards must exceed that of the dealers but must be lower than 21

Roulette - 
Use action keys to determine how much is being bet, the odds for your bet, and then position your chips on the table. Up to 10 bets can be placed at a time.

Poker - 
The game is five card draw poker and the player plays against the dealer. The aim is to beat the dealer by either having a better hand or bluffing the dealer into quitting.
After cards have been dealt both the player and the dealer can stay, bet or drop/fold. If both the player and the dealer remain in the game then cards can be exchanged and a second round takes place after which cards are shown and the hand is won/lost.

Craps - 
This is a dice game where bets are placed on the anticipated spot value of the next throw. The player chooses the stake to be wagered and then the type of bet to be made, 'big six', 'big eight', 'pass line bet' etc. 

The game features authentic rules.

The action involves moving along the base of the screen, while wave after wave of aliens come towards you. The yellow aliens split when shot, while the magenta ones are the toughest of all. Once the coast is clear you must manually dock, with a points bonus on offer.

        <desc>In Moonsweeper your goal is to rescue miners from the moons in Star Quadrant Jupiter. You begin your mission in space where you must avoid deadly aurora flares, photon torches and space bullets from the sun in this quadrant. From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).

But, as was habitual in his experiments, he had failed in his objective and now a gang of uncontrolled hens is circulating around the city putting eggs on the street.  But certain special eggs have the capacity to turn one person into a hen (or at least that's what they believed) if the egg crushes on his head.

MOT is nothing less than a 3 meter tall inter-dimensional monster (complete with a tail and horns), which can travel through the planes of time and space as easily as you go from your bedroom to the kitchen. 

Moreover, MOT has the bad habits of hiding in your cupboard, smashing all the furniture in your house from time to time or eating all the food in your fridge during the night.
And of course,  when you tried to explain to your parents that it wasn't you but MOT who crushed their car, they sent you to a psychiatrist.

But MOT is your friend, and you wouldn't let him down when he calls for your help, would you ?

        <desc>Riding a dirt bike you must complete the stages within a time limit. There are 5 skills sections on tough mountain terrain, and 4 relatively smooth time trials. Hazards such as sand dunes, logs, rocks and gullies are out to stop you. You'll have to wheelie to clear the rocks and before hitting jumps, angling the bike so as to aim for the same slope as the land, and make sure to land on the back wheel to avoid falling. Any infraction loses you one of your bikes - you start with 3 but get a new one after successfully completing a stage.

        <name>Ms. Pac-Man (48K)</name>
        <desc>In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".

As ever, you must avoid the ghosts and collect the dots, with power-pills on offer so as to make the ghosts edible, for bonus points as so as to buy some time.

        <name>NARC (128K)</name>
        <desc>Narc is a 1-2 player game, where your mission is to infiltrate the Mr. Big Corporation, the scourge of the underworld. To do this, you must get through the game's eight stages, with over ten sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where Mr. Big resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a number of safe cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit.  Each sector includes a map, and should be easy to read. For example, the blue or red dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile launchers, while the "E" indicates the exit.

Your mission ain't going to be easy, as you will come face-to-face with enemies including the canine mutts, Das Lof Gang, Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead, Kinky Pinky, Sgt. Skyhigh, HQ Posse, and Mr. Big himself. You have two ways you can deal with them: either put a bullet in them or make arrests. Furthermore, they will try to blow you up the minute they see you. Fortunately, you're armed with a shotgun and missile launcher, but these both have a limited supply of ammunition. If your bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it is important not to waste all of your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later enemies like Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine.

More often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items that they drop, including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards.  Even if you got the safe card and can pass the level, you can keep blowing up enemies to score more points. According to the game, this game is for training purposes only, so you will not get employed by your local DEA office. Is this what the DEA does every day: go on rampages?

The loadout and starting positions are predefined, but you can change the loadout, choosing from two types of ammo, three types of rockets, explosives, first aid kits, transporters, and armor.

The game plays like a strategic third person shooter. You control the commander of the current squad, and can switch between the three. Also, there are computer terminals scattered around that can turn off some of the automated defenses and cameras.

        <desc>2000AD hero Nemesis must defeat the evil Torquemada, the Grand Master of Termight, and the hordes of Terminators he has dispatched. The game is set on a succession of 30 single-screen levels comprising of networks of platforms. You are armed with a gun (with limited ammunition) and a sword, and must kill a set amount of Terminators on each level. Terminators follow a set pattern, so you can work out which ledges they will reach next. Dead Terminators remain on the screen - when you are not doing well, Torquemata can sometimes turn these into vicious scythe-wielding zombies.

        <name>New Zealand Story, The (128K)</name>
        <desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.

The action is side-scrolling, with 5 different positions on the screen featuring a variety of clear spaces and hazards. Time bonuses and speed boosts are available.

Each weapon offers its own advantages and must be used at certain times to overcome specific obstacles or opponents. 

The game's coin-op origins are evident in the fact that it does not have passwords or saves. To compensate for this, however, adjustable difficulty settings were added.

        <desc>Two player side scrolling beat-em-up converted from the Taito coin-op that featured three monitor screens side by side. The Amiga version was developed in letterbox format in order to show as much of the wide screen background graphics as possible. 

The player(s) controlled robot Ninjas, which battled their way through the levels using Shuriken and knives. As the Ninja's took damage their classic Ninja garb was torn away to reveal robotic limbs, torso or head. When the damage reached critical the Ninja Robot would explode, scattering mechanical body parts.

As with The Sales Curve's later title SWIV, The Ninja Warriors used the company's Dynamic Loading System to load sprites, sound and background graphics from disk on the fly.

Nodes of Yesod is an Arcade Adventure seen from a side-scrolling perspective. Charlie can jump and, after finding it first, use a device called mole. After pressing up on on the joystick, Charlie stands still and the player gains control over the mole that can be used to attack enemies. However, not all enemies can be harmed by the mole. Another useful device is the burrowing chum that can be used to dig through certain walls. Before Charlie can reach the monolith, he has to explore the many caverns of the moon and find eight keys or alchiems. Every now and then a red spaceman will show up, and touching him will cause Charlie to loose one of his keys.

Before Charlie can reach the monolith, he has to explore the many caverns of the moon and find eight keys or alchiems. Every now and then a red spaceman will show up, and touching him will cause Charlie to loose one of his keys.

        <desc>So you want to be a Knight of the King Abdul Honeickam Gargoy, young countryman? I can see that you are accurate with the arch, fast with the sword, and tough in hand-to-hand combat... but you need to prove that you're brave enough!

My boy, you'll be locked in the Castle with no name. You've to survive the nightmare world inside... and escape alive! Others have tried without success, and were sadly transformed into ogres by the evil mage Nirlem. Good luck!

This was one of the first games by Dinamic. It's a challenging side-scrolling game with Ghosts N' Goblins style gameplay, with some strange monsters (you know, the Castle was previously owned by Alucard!) and potions that can help you a bit. By the way... you can climb ropes, and will frequently need to.

        <desc>The Northstar space station has been overrun by aliens, with all reports suggesting that the crew didn't survive. It's your job to progress through its floors, wipe out the aliens and restore order.

What this entails is essentially a case of walking from left to right taking out everything you see. You are armed with a lance, which you can use from some distance, although you can only attack in one direction at a time, although aliens can come at you from all around, many of them using some wicked patterns. There are ledges to be climbed; the lance can be used to hoist your way up.

 Enemies often give off bubbles (for points) or stars (collect for an extra life). You are limited in the amount of oxygen you have to complete a level, and you  have 4 lives, one of which is lost on contact.

Being rather attached to his castle, Sir Humphrey wants to scare Eugene away for good. Unfortunately, Sir Humphrey has lost his ability to make himself invisible. He can only regain his power by mixing special ingredients that Olli must find.

In this flick-screen platform game you control Olli who must find each ingredient and return it one after another to Sir Humphrey within a set time limit.
In each screen there are spooks, snakes and bats as well as dangerous gapes to avoid. Olli cannot really die, but when touched by a baddie he gets set back at the start of a screen costing valuable time.

Collect all eight ingredients and Eugine Portcullis III Jnr. will be scared away for good.

        <desc>Operation Thunderbolt is the exciting sequel to Operation Wolf. An airliner is hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren't released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.

There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.

You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane,  proves to be difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs.

There are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.

        <desc>You have been recruited for Operation Wolf, a desperate attempt to rescue prisoners from the enemy. Through a series of missions, you'll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol boats to helicopters, and more. Can you carry the day?

Operation Wolf is an arcade conversion of the game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to "pick them up". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. 

You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial. 

Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.

Kendo involves using a stick as your weapon, whereas Kung Fu various punches and kicks and Kyo-Kus-Hin-Kai involves head butts and flying attacks. You can jump over opponents; a quick tap of the fire button turns you around. You have an energy bar with 5 blocks of gradually decreasing colours, which drops when you are hit and increases as you pass time without being hit. Impressive moves earn you bonus Merit Awards.

On the 16-bit versions, there are 3 skill levels (Novice, Professional and Master), digitised sound, and an editor to set up joystick moves. The 8-bit versions lack these niceties, but include an extra discipline, Sumo; these are played in sequence rather than by choice.

        <desc>Pac-Land is a side-scrolling 1-2 player game with a cartoony feel to it. Now equipped with arms, face, and legs, Pac must guide a fairy back to her home in Fairy Land, but this task will not be easy because Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue will pursue Pac-Man as he travels through Pac-Land. When he finally transports the fairy back to her home, Pac is given some magic shoes, which will help him get to his own home, where he will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss. 

There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.

        <name>Pac-Man (Atarisoft) (48K)</name>
        <desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.

        <name>Pac-Mania (128K)</name>
        <desc>Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man. You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the dots on the board in order to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!

The player is the titular pakacuda fish and has to make his way through the maze and eat all the smaller fishes he comes across. The pakacuda is not only a predator but a prey too. He has to avoid the octopuses that chase him around the maze. If he comes into contact with an octopus he will lose one life. To protect himself the player has to eat eels that provides him with a charge enough to take on the octopuses. He is charged only during a limited time though and once it's over the defeated octopuses will reappear.</desc>

        <desc>Pang is a platform game which consists of 50 levels in total. It can be played with one or two players on the same screen, and the other player can join anytime within the game. 

Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can shoot hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if they're at their minimum size. Apart from balloons, some levels also have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your access to balloons. There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump. 

You can also pick up power-ups such as: the ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that attaches to the ceiling and waits 'til something bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire but cannot destroy barriers. Beside extra weapons, you can also pick certain things like clock (halting time for a small period), dynamite (reducing all balls to minimum size, thus making you able to reach more points), life, and such.

The player mans a ground based gun. Helicopters and bombers fly overhead dropping paratroopers and bombs. The player must prevent these from landing as, when enough of them have made it to earth, they turn into a tank and destroy the players gun.
Every shot fired costs points but these can be regained by bringing down aircraft and paratroopers.</desc>

        <desc>Paris-Dakar is a rally simulator in which the player controls a wide variety of variables, including the state of the car (gasoline, water, damages, gear box...) and the race route (always accessible), among others. If needed, the player can refuel, buy water or whatever else is required from the powerboats in Europe or the tankers in Africa. Prices of these essential materials aren't always very reasonable, given the player's meagre starting wallet, motivating players to earn higher sponsorships through strong performance in the race.

There are three different stages: one in Europe, another one in the desert of the Sahara, and finally a crossing of the Tenere desert before arriving in Dakar.

There are four difficulty levels to select the skill of the computer controlled player. One or two players may play but always against the computer. In a two player game, both players play as a doubles team.

The game starts off looking behind the player as the style of serve is chosen (top spin, curve, etc) and then it switches to a top down view for the rally.

The ship must avoid crashing into the surface of the caverns (which have a jagged pattern of being higher in some parts than in others), or the mounted radar bases or seeker missiles. Fortunately you are armed with both a forward-shooting laser and downward-arcing bombs.

The game has a training mode, which is useful to help you practice the game with infinite lives, as well as a simultaneous 2-player mode. There's also an editor allowing you to design the cavern layout yourself, and save your creations to tape.

        <desc>"Perico Delgado Maillot Amarillo", a game based on the Spanish champion, was one of the first cycling simulators that reproduced accurately the ups and downs of one of the hardest sports. Here you can run in a singular test (after seeing the informative track profile), divided each one in four parts completely different and in which your reflections will be continuously put on approval. 

Try to start the race in first position and obtain a perfect rate in your pedaling, at the same way you avoid the dangerous fans in smooth land; run in the hardest of the mountain ports in continuous struggle against the chronometer; descend at full speed through a street flooded of curves and finally arrive to the exciting final sprint, showing that you are worthy to take the yellow jersey.

        <desc>Rather than attempting to simulate the whole of football, this title concentrated on the goalkeeper's task of saving shots. In each match you will face a succession of shots from different distances and angles, and aim to save as many as possible. 16 teams were included for you to select your team and opposition from. There's a practice mode, and a skill challenge, where you move up through the game by saving 4 successive shots. The C64 version has a little sampled speech and extra sound.

        <desc>Your mission here is really obscure. You must destroy the evil Count Dracula who is devastating the region. The scenario of your nightmare will be the Castle of this malevolent personage.  Throughout 95 horrifying rooms you will be besieged by his slaves, try to avoid them and obtain the greater amount of food as possible. If you reunite the 5 keys and you introduce them in its 5 corresponding bolts you would have done a very important part of the mission. In order to obtain each key you must find a certain object and fix it in the "generator by pedals", if you do it well you will be able to jump the enormous pit. The second part of your mission consists in opening the 6 magical counter-windows pressing the suitable switches. Finally, search for the hammer and the stake and walk quickly to the superior part of the castle to take the cross. At this moment you will be teleported to the space to get rid of the final confrontation in which you will be able to use the laser weapon and the self-propelled knapsack.

        <desc>This single-screen top-down action puzzler stars Pippo, a cute creature who must change the colour of each square on a screen. There are 32 levels – the concept is that the number of times a square must be stepped on to change it to the right colour starts at one and increases every four levels, but there’s a bug in the game meaning that odd-numbered levels always need one change, and even-numbered levels always need two. The levels are on 6x4 grids, although these include lots of holes, which Pippo must avoid. 

There are also many nasties patrolling the area – some kill him, while others reset any previous colour changes but can be killed on contact (The Bobby Yazz Show has a similar design on this element). Pacman-style power pills temporarily change enemies into harmless springs. The game features a lot of technical effects and hardware tricks, including full-screen numbers using the normally-blank border.

        <desc>The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam. In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.

The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.

The next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room to search.

After escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance.

Finally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.

This is done against a time limit, and there are special blocks to help out with extra lives.

        <desc>Poli Diaz is a boxing game protagonized by the Spanish boxing star of the late eighties, Policarpio Díaz. This game uses an isometric perspective where two boxers revolve around the center of the ring, with no possibility of going back, and we observe it from a corner of the quadrilateral. The options menu is the usual: one or two player mode, choose the control type and the number of assaults and lenght of the same.

Our first opponent will be a sparring, that without offering much opposition, will allow us to learn about the control of the game. After this weak opponent is defeated, you will have to fight (in order) for the titles of Spain, Europe and the World against other opponents.

"Poli Diaz" has two different modes of control, one of attack and other of defence. In the former, and with the appropriate combination of hits and movement, we will attack the contrary, and in the second we will cover of the  punches that undoubtedly fall over us. In this context, using a joystick could be recommendable.

        <desc>The object of the game is to collect hearts and deliver them to Olive Oyle to keep her 'lovemeter' topped up. Points are scored for hearts delivered.
Bluto, UFO's, witches etc try to stop you. Some hearts are behind locked doors so you've got to find the right key to open the door and get them while others can be grabbed simply by jumping up to get them.
Somewhere there's a fruit machine for which you need to collect 'spin' items.

The game boasts a 'clever multidimensional effect' which allows Popeye to go behind the scenery and go through doors.

        <name>Popeye 2 (48K)</name>
        <desc>Strange happenings are afoot once again in Sweethaven and only Popeye can make it right. In Popeye 2, our spinach lovin' hero must once again rescue Olive Oyl and make mincemeat of Bluto while looking after Swee'Pea, feeding Wimpy and keeping an eye on Jeep.

Popeye has four different levels to traverse through. His initial adventure takes him to a construction site where bouncing springs, falling girders and open welding flames impede his progress. Rolling barrels, and bombs which must be touched to be put out also stand to cause harm. In every level scattered hamburgers must be collected in order for Popeye to get past Wimpy who is often hanging out somewhere near the top of every vertically scrolling platform level. There are also feats of strength that Popeye must perform by beating up a punching robot-type thing with the aid of Spinach. Once past all these obstacles Popeye can move on to the next level.

The second level takes Popeye into the urban jungle where he must climb the side of the Biff Spinach building and avoid the same obstacles as in the previous levels. In the third level falling girders are replaced with giant bananas as Popeye finds himself in a jungle. Coconut throwing monkeys hang from ledges and snoozing tigers and snakes decorate the trees. The fourth and final level of the game finds Popeye climbing the masts of the S.S. Trev and the S.S. Andy as he makes his way to a final confrontation with Bluto and rescue Olive Oyl.

Popeye is able to jump around and occasionally when the situation calls for it punch his way through this vertical platformer. Bonus points are rewarded for finding Swee'Pea and Jeep. He can take multiple hits before he takes a curtain call but thankfully is unharmed by long drops. The player should beware as Popeye has only one life to get through the four levels of this adventure.

There are 5 tracks to choose from, each with 5 stages. The stages range from cities, to deserts to tracks over water. There are also 12 drivers to pick from, from businessmen to skinheads and mohicans. 

Your buggy has 2 gears, high and low. Once the light goes green, just keep the pedal to the metal. You’ll need to place third or higher to continue to the next stage. Be careful not to bump into other buggies or objects next to the road. While you’re buggy can take a pounding, crashing will slow you down. 

Finish all 5 stages in a level and you’ll be presented with a bonus level.

        <desc>Predator is a side-scrolling platformer which uses the imagery and characters from the classic Arnie movie of the same name. The game is not a faithfully conversion of the movie however - your unit has already been killed off when the game starts and you will battle scorpions, enemy soldiers and dodge obstacles etc, before facing the Predator itself a number of times.

The game is a fairly standard run-jump-shoot platformer, except that you start with no weapons at all and must collect them as the game goes on.

The game is a crosshair shooter influenced by Operation Wolf. The viewpoint is from slightly behind Harrington, while the game scrolls on as you clear each section. Mouse control is offered on 16-bit versions. Your armour must be kept functional by collecting top-ups, and there are weapon power-ups such as machine guns and rocket launchers to be had. You can't go in all-guns-blazing however, as killing a single innocent causes Harrington to lose his job

The route to the castle in which her ugly sister has imprisoned her is treacherous and goes both indoors and out. You're armed with a dagger to face the many henchmen infesting the areas. Bread and ale can be collected to restore your health, and there are lots of points bonuses on offer. Less pleasant are the super glue, ball &amp; chain (ironic given that he's chasing a potential wife) and poison.

The controls are fairly simple: left and right on the joystick rotates the skier and the fire button propels the player character forward with his sticks. Avoid obstacles such as trees, gates or log cabins.

Dodge between radars, sneak under enemy fighters, and take out your primary objectives and secondary objectives with your limited weapons onboard, then make your way home. Can you survive all the way to general and win the Congressional Medal of Honor?

F-19 Stealth Fighter was based around Sid Meier's closest estimate of the stealth fighter based on the data available at the time. You get full 3D graphics, 3D enemies, random objectives and enemy dispositions (so each mission will be different), dynamic radar effectiveness that depends on your position and radar cross section, enemies that search you out if you do "tickle" their defenses, even civilian aircrafts in the air, and ability to play in cold war, moderate war, or all-out war, with very different rules of engagement.

The ultimate holiday destination in the Universe is a planetoid called Dreams, half a light year from the centre of the Belt of Unreality, second on the left of Andromeda. The reason for its popularity is the strangeness and slight danger of each persons playground for the rich, and in the Season of High Unlikelihood you have decided to take a vacation here. Your vacation has become a treasure hunt in a fantasy castle, searching for four parts of a valuable on each level bouncing on a bouncebubble full of poisonous gas armed with a blunderbuss. As you bounce from the left to get to the far right of the level, you must shoot or avoid the various nasties on the screen and if you touch one then a gas gauge decreases and when it empties then you lose one of three lives. You must also complete the level before a timer reaches zero or the bouncebubble will explode and some obstacles kill you instantly if touched.</desc>

When they are thrown, the bombs will count down from the number shown on the bomb, and explode when they reach zero. But they will explode immediately once they hit their target, regardless of the countdown. Items can be picked up along the way that will help you defeat opponents. One of them is a knapsack that allows you to carry more than one bomb at a time. After certain levels, a bonus game appears, and the object of this game is to attempt to kiss the lady pigs as they pop in and out of their holes.

        <desc>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.

There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)

The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.

        <desc>Wally Week has become trapped inside one of his own nightmares, and is in danger of failing to wake up from it in time for work. Only you can save him from the inevitable sack, by finding the key that can be used to bring your alarm clock to life.

The world inside his head is large and varied, with escalators, lifts and locked doors used to navigate it. Only two objects can be carried at a time, but some must be used in tandem, and others only become active when you walk over them while carrying one or two items they require to become active. 

As this is a nightmare world, not everything is as it seems - everything is enlarged, and axes, punching hands and ghosts are all out to get you. Your energy is measured by a 'Snooze Energy' meter depicted by a glass of milk - once this drops to minimum, one of your 3 lives is lost.

Get the jet-pack to make it easier to navigate the level and shoot any inhabitants that get in the way. These inhabitants will leave behind something that you can get to increase your score, and the inhabitants will eventually regenerate. If any one of them touches you while you have the jet-pack, you land on the ground or the nearest platform, and have to get it again; and the same rule applies to the key.

        <desc>Quazatron started life as Steve Turner's port of Commodore 64 shoot 'em up Paradroid , by his longtime partner Andy Braybrook, but during the design process he decided to change the view to an isometric one, as this would suit the system more. Knowledge of Paradroid is an advantage (not least because it's a splendid game), as most aspects of the game overlap, including the plot, which sets you as the renegade robot KLP-2, armed with experimental technology to attack enemy droids. 

Your task is to deactivate robots, which can be done in a number of ways - shooting them, gaining control of them so as to deactivate them (known as 'grappling') or pushing them off their circuits. Knowing which method to use in each situation can only come from practice. Grappling is done from a separate screen, and involves aiming at the enemy droid's 12 sectors so as to turn at least 7 of them to your colour. When this is done successfully you can harvest some of the droid's components for your own use - a clear grappling victory gives you more chance of these elements being undamaged and usable.

        <desc>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.

The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).

The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.

        <desc>Fox is a member of the special corps CEO, and his next assignment is in the Soviet city of Chernovska. The last CEO member who was sent there went missing after sending a report on a new military project called RAM.

R.A.M. is a side-scrolling action platformer where the player takes control of Fox. When the game begins Fox has landed far away from his objective and he needs to cross several areas packed with enemy soldiers. At first, Fox has to rely on his assault rifle and his hand grenades, but later on he can use stationary guns and even vehicles. The vehicles need fuel, and their clever use is essential in succeeding.

        <desc>The Race Against Time is a game based on Sport Aid '88, a global program of sport, music, and carnival, cultivating in the simultaneous 10km world-wide run that took place on September 11, 1988. Millions of people around the world joined the campaign to help children worldwide by fighting hunger, poverty, and disease.

Players take on the role of Omar Khalifa, the legendary Sudanese athlete who has decided to participate. Starting from the El Mowheli relief camp in Sudan, he has limited time to raise a flag and light a flame in each of the six continents. Khalifa's journey has him pass famous landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty, the United Nations, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Mt. Rushmore, the Sydney Opera House, the Colosseum, and the Eiffel Tower. There are multiple routes on each continent.

Khalifa can pick up objects to help him reach places, but only one object can be carried at a time. He can also get an hourglass which will give him more time. The run is over when Khalifa runs out of time or when he comes into contact with dangers he must face.

        <desc>Tough Vietnam veteran John Rambo is called back into action after some soldiers are taken hostage in a PoW camp. His orders are to simply capture photographic evidence of the war crimes taking place, but after finding a close friend tied up, he decides to wipe them all out by himself. This being Hollywood, chances are that he will succeed.

Ocean's interpretation of his challenge recreates Commando fairly closely. You move up the screen, taking out enemies – these respawn, so there is no value in not moving upwards as quickly as possible. Find strategic positions from which to attack. Touch each hostage you find to free them.

You have knives and grenades, but using the latter alerts the enemy as to your presence, making life harder. Extra weapons such as rocket launchers and machine guns can be collected en route.

        <desc>Rambo's mission is set deep in Afghanistan, in the days when the Soviets occupied it, and America was putting this right (we won't mention who they enlisted to do so). Colonel Trautman has been kidnapped by the Soviets, and you've gone in there to rescuing him. Doing so is a three-part operation approximately following the plot of the film.

In the first part, you explore the building Trautman could be in, through a top-down view of the building. It is heavily protected by infra-red security beams, which when activated unleadsh the enemies. The locations of the beams are only apparent if you collect the special goggles. Other hazards include mines, trapdoors and booby-trapped doors, but there are enhanced weapons to collect.

Section two is identical to the first, except that it is located outside, the enemy are onto you from the start, and there are no traps. The final section changes to an Operation Wolf-style shoot 'em up, with a horde of tanks, foot soldiers and helicopters to face. Your gun can jam, which adds to the challenge of finally getting out alive.

        <desc>George, Lizzy and Ralph were just ordinary Americans, until an experiment went wrong, turning them into a Gorilla, Lizard and Werewolf respectively. Following this, the three of them plan to go round destroying buildings, and up to 3 human players can join in.

Smashing at the edges of the buildings for long enough will make them collapse. The police and military are after you, and will shoot at you, so try to destroy them (failing that, you can avoid the bullets). You will need to eat regularly, with things like plants on offer, to avoid shrinking back to being human

        <desc>The purpose of apprentice courses is for young people to learn a trade gradually, without putting yourself or your employers at risk. Unfortunately, nobody explained this to Wizard’s apprentice Mervyn, before he tried to cast a spell to make him irresistible to females, as the spell misfired, and made him attractive only to female frogs. However, his dungeon was soon invaded, and Mervyn was not killed, as he appeared to be a humble frog.

Viewed from above, the aim is to kill all 96 of the wizards who have invaded the dungeon, which is split into 8 levels, each made up of 16 screens and at least 50 rooms. To see what’s in a room he has to enter it, in a manner similar to the Switchblade games.

The game’s rather esoteric title comes from the way you obtain spells to upgrade the four different types of power you have (power, offence, defence and effect). When you meet a warlock you enter a mini game in which the letters RANARAMA are in random order, and by swapping pairs of letters in sequence you must form the full word in as little time as possible. This system of having a sub-game for collecting upgrades is similar to the ‘grappling’ concept in Paradroid.

This earns up to four of the Runes (Mysticism, Witchcraft, Magecraft and Runecraft), each of which can be used on one of the four types of power. The Magecraft offensive use is a fireball, defence for Runecraft makes you invisible to enemies, and the special effect for Witchcraft allows you to jump through space. Lose a life and you lose all these powers, and losing another life means it’s Game Over.

        <desc>Renegade 3 was the third and last in the Imagine's series, based on the original coin-op by Taito. The hero's girlfriend has been beamed into the future, while the man himself has been sent back into prehistory. This sets the scene for a sideways scrolling arena combat game, where the player fights in various time periods. The settings varied from Egyptian and medieval, to a futuristic level. As such, gone are the attacks of street gangs from the first two iterations of the series, replaced by assailants such as knights in armor and robots. In each level you have six minutes to reach the finish, as this is all the time the time-travel portal is available for. There are many surface hazards to avoid, as well as multi-layered Green Beret-style areas. You can kick and punch at different heights, allowing you to deal with each of the diverse foes.

        <name>Rescate Atlantida (Spanish) (128K)</name>
        <desc>The advanced civilization of the planet Somerset built a gigantic exploratory spaceship called Atlantis, and sent it to research the planet Earth. After the completion of its task, the ship submerged to an oceanic abyss. The D.A.G. ("giant-looking depredators"), a war-mongering civilization, took possession of Atlantis with the intention of conquering Somerset and the universe. Somerset sends a hero to rescue Atlantis from the enemy, and return it home.

Rescue from Atlantis is a Spanish side-scrolling action-adventure game divided in three loads:

1.  In the first load, the hero must find a way to gain entrance to the camouflage city built on top of Atlantis. This level starts with the bathysphere being dropped from the sky into the ocean by a spaceship. Once it hits the bottom, the player can guide it by using O and P to move left and right, respectively. Q makes it go up, and A cycles through its inventory. The bathysphere is armed with a laser gun that can be fired by pressing the SPACE bar. Hitting M ejects the protagonist from the bathysphere as to explore more strait entrances. Once out, M also serves as the GET, DROP, ENTER and USE button. There are objects scattered on the sea floor to be collected and used. The bathysphere also comes with some useful paraphernalia:

? A laser pistol to kill the enemy and the sea life;
? A jetpack to reach higher places;
? A portable computer to connect with the main one in Atlantis;
? A mould to fabricate gold bars. There are some gold nuggets on the submersed caves (to melt them the player has to find a source of heat);
? A first-aid kit that can only be used once.

The player investigates a complex of aquatic tunnels while collecting the needed tools for the task ahead. At the top of the screen there are two horizontal bars. The leftmost indicates the oxygen level (there are places on the levels that replenish it). The one in the right side is the bathysphere fuel level, once empty the vessel will stop moving. The player must find sources of fuel to make it swim again. Amongst the two bars sits the inventory of both the bathysphere and the character. At the bottom of the screen there are two scores and a plant between them. The plant is the energy level of the character, it changes with every hit he/she/it receives. The left score is the current score, the one on the right is the top score. In this first load, the main danger comes from the creatures of the sea: octopuses, sharks and abyssal fishes take a bit of the energy when the character touches them.

 In the second load the bathysphere enters the city that was raised on Atlantis, now under the sea and in ruins. Guarding the entrance to the ship is Korx, a powerful D.A.G. mage. The main objective of this level is to find a way to destroy him (he is invulnerable to the laser weapons). Besides the animals of the previous load, the character has to fight hammerheads and some alien creatures.

 The final load sees the bathysphere entering Atlantis. The ship is a mechanical labyrinth, with lifts and sentinel robots. The main objective is to find the computer room, where the hero can activate the ship and bring it back to Somerset.

The game has a password system: after solving each load, an alphanumeric code is displayed on the screen. The code is generated based on the actions accomplished. The second and third load require this code to start. It is possible to reach an unwinnable situation by failing to collect or assemble the necessary objects for the completion of a later level.

        <desc>Rex the dinosaur is fed up of the environmental damage being done by a nearby nuclear plant. As a result, he takes to the heavily-guarded tunnels that lead to it, with the intention of ridding the world of nuclear power forever.

The game is viewed from the side in a flick-screen format. Rex jumps and shoots, staking out various walking and flying enemies. Walking on to a Beam Pad means that upon losing a life, you will resume from the screen on which you died. As enemies are dying, keep shooting at them to keep increasing your score.

There are power-ups to collect, through energy bubbles. Each weapon has 5 possible energy levels, and can only be used if you have enough. Collect a bubble when you weapon is at the top level and you will collect an improved weapon.

        <desc>You play Rick Dangerous, an Indiana Jones type who's on a quest to find the lost Coolu Amazon tribe.  However, his plane crashes in the middle of a bunch of crazed Coolus. Hopefully he's up to the challenge of escaping. If he is, he will find himself in the pyramid of Egypt with no easy way past leaders and their minions, and then engulfed in a web of traps in a Nazi base.

Rick Dangerous is a platform game across over 100 screens, in which Rick has his gun in one hand, and dynamite sticks in another. You must take a methodical approach to clearing each screen, as there are traps in place which will need memorizing and preempting where possible. Use the dynamite wisely, for enemies you can't get into the purely-horizontal range of your gun.

        <desc>Your role as Rick Dangerous demands that you stop the Fat Guy and his evil plans to help an alien race take over control of our world. The journey takes in Hyde Park, Ice Caverns, Forest and Atomic Mines. He must solve positional puzzles and memorise the locations of laser bolts and booby traps, as well as avoiding enemies including robots, penguins and nomads. As in the first game, a fifth level is unlocked after you complete the four standard levels.

Rick can climb ladders and crawl through tight spaces. He is equipped with a laser gun and six little bombs, but can also punch with some effect. The controls are very easy to understand: pressing fire+up shoots the gun, pressing fire+down places a bomb, pressing fire+bottom-left/bottom-right makes Rick slide a bomb along the floor in the specified direction.

        <name>Road Blasters (128K)</name>
        <desc>RoadBlasters is a futuristic racing action game. The goal is to reach the finish line in one piece throughout each of 50 levels. Numerous enemies are out on the road to try and stop you, including armored cars, motorcycles, canons on the side of the road, landmines, and more. 

Your vehicle is equipped with a machine gun to help you out, and occasionally a weapons plane will fly in and drop additional power ups that can be collected. Some of these are the U.Z. canon, cruise missiles, and speed boost. Your car has a very limited amount of fuel, however more can be picked up along the way by crossing the halfway point of a level, or by collecting the red and green fuel spheres that appear in the road or after destroying certain enemies.  On many levels collecting fuel is critical otherwise you won't be able to reach the finish line.

In the first Road Runner must peck as much seed from the ground of a single screen as he can, while avoiding the myriad traps and dangers Wile E. Coyote throws at him from the sky. The more seed you can peck, the better your chances will be in take 2.  This involves running away from Wile E, jumping the traps he has laid and finally reaching the safety of a big drop, which you will clear and watch Wile E. fall through, just like the cartoons.

Robin must rescue Maid Marion from the clutches of the Sheriff of Nottingham, collecting treasure along the way. Robin is armed with a bow and arrow with which to take out gargoyles, trolls and the like. The level designs are long and maze-like, with a need to collect keys and uncover secret passageways in order to find all sections of them, and the gold they contain. Many of the moving platforms are only activated by collecting a key for them from elsewhere.

        <desc>Patrolman Alex Murphy was killed on the streets of Detroit. The major corporation there, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell a new kind of law enforcement officer to the troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...

Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal's face to the proper mugshot and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.

If you didn't destroy/kill enough, you'll be transported to a training mission, which is a first-person perspective shoot 'em up. Should you also fail the training, you must go to the beginning of the previous mission. Successfully completed mission or enough points scored by training allow you to proceed to the next stage. Unlike in the first RoboCop, there's no time limit, and you are able to jump.

Cimbel Lin, Ted Matare, Jansen Sino and Fighter Bull must be dealt with in order, with fights getting tougher as you progress.The action is viewed in 3D, from behind your boxer and with a full view of your opponent. A health bar is provided for each player, going from green to red as hits are scored. When the strength goes down to zero, a punch will floor your opponent - either player can be seen hitting the floor when a knockout blow is struck. Three knockouts are required to win a fight.

        <desc>You are Cecil Pitt, a wannabe rock star manager. You must choose from 1-4 rock stars (with names such as Tina Turnoff and Wacko Jacko) to manage by viewing their audition tapes. Once you chosen your artists you then have to choose what kind of gear to get them - spanking new, second hand or dodgy. The dodgy gear is dirt cheap but you might pay for your choice later on in the game.

To make your group a star, you have options such as practicing, publicity stunts, and buying gifts for your stars. Each action you choose advances the calendar by one day and you have until December to achieve your ultimate aim of superstardom - represented by a line graph which rises or falls depending on the performance of your band's releases.

Once your band has recorded their first album you can choose to release the single and/or the album. The single needs a video to go with it which costs varying amounts of cash depending on which director you choose. You can choose to go for publicity, but this can be risky as there is a chance that one of your rock stars will be in the papers as an ex-rock star who died in any of many strange ways (all that's missing is a 'bizarre gardening accident'). Publicity affects your sales directly and also affects the crowds who attend your gigs. You lose the game if either you run out of money, or all of your rock stars die.

        <desc>Our Stallone-inspired hero has four fights to win before becoming champion boxer in this sports game. Cimbel Lin, Ted Matare, Jansen Sino and Fighter Bull must be dealt with in order, with fights getting tougher as you progress.The action is viewed in 3D, from behind your boxer and with a full view of your opponent. A health bar is provided for each player, going from green to red as hits are scored. When the strength goes down to zero, a punch will floor your opponent - either player can be seen hitting the floor when a knockout blow is struck. Three knockouts are required to win a fight.

        <desc>Taking a rather literal view of the term 'slap-stick humour', Rodland features two fairies called Tam and Rit, whose mission is to rescue their mum who's been captured and taken to a castle. 

There are 40 screens to clear, all full of baddies, who are disposed of by grabbing them with a stick, and flipping them from side to side to inflict damage. The hits needn't all be inflicted at the same time, as it's possible to release them to move them out of the way.

When killed, each bad guy releases some kind of extra, ranging from points bonuses to various devices which can be used to kill other enemies.

Each level also contains a certain amount of fruit. If you can collect all of this (with some bad guys still alive - you move on immediately once they're gone) you enter a bonus game, in which each enemy's death results in one of the letters E,X,T,R and A being released - collect them all for an invaluable extra life.

In the Game Boy version the difficulty lies slightly lower because the player can use his wand even when climbing ladders.

        <desc>Due to an accident involving Professor Flipnoodles' Pocket Rocket (would you trust a scientist called Flipnoodles? I certainly wouldn't, especially as mad scientists cause so many computer game plot disasters) the Hanna Barbera characters have been hurtled into space. The Lilli-Punies have kidnapped them, and will only let them free if they can rescue their missing compatriots.

The search starts on the surface of the planet, but also takes Ruff underground into the cavernous regions the Lilli-Punies live in. These have lots of water, which Ruff must avoid. Plenty of extra lives can be collected along the way, with solving puzzles as important as good reactions and dexterity.

        <desc>An evil being known as Ligar is about to conquer the land of Argool. Such is his power that no living creature dares to cross paths with him. But the legendary warrior Rygar rises from his grave to restore peace and justice. Armed with his famed weapon Diskarmor, Rygar begins to traverse the vast lands that lead to the lair of the demon, as his minions are trying in vain to stop him...

Originally released on the arcades, Rygar is a side-scrolling action game. The player controls the titular hero, advancing through stages populated by hostile creatures. Beside the Diskarmor, a weapon that looks like a shield with a chain attached to it, the hero can use a variety of other weapons, including projectiles that can be fired in four directions. Various "powers" are scattered through the levels and can be collected. The effects of these powers include increasing the fire power of the equipped weapon, adding time to the clock, temporary invisibility, extra points, etc.

        <desc>Based on the 1989 Atari Games (not to be confused with Atari Corporation, producers of the Lynx) coin-op by Ed Rotberg.  It's 2492 and you must pilot your Sub-Terranean Underground Network (S.T.U.N.) craft at speeds over 900 miles per hour through a series of courses to retain your title as S.T.U.N. Runner, completing each course before time runs out.

There are also enemies on each course, such as cycles, indestructible armored drones, and flying bird-like craft.  Shoot or avoid them.  If you hit them, you lose one of your shields (your craft has six total) and are slowed down temporarily.  The more shields you have at the finish line, the more bonus points you get.  Getting hit with no shields does not kill you, however.  There are no lives in this game.  The only way to lose is to fail to cross the finish line.

Along the way you'll encounter Boost Pads that temporarily speed you up to incredible speeds and make you indestructible.  By running over enough green stars on each course, you can also earn Shockwaves, which destroy all enemies in your path.

Note that there is no accelerator in this game.  Your craft always goes full speed, unless you hit something.  Then you will slow down, but quickly accelerate back to full speed.  Other than that, you cannot slow down and the only way to speed up is to run over a Boost Pad.  Your only controls are steering left and right and aiming the gun on top of your craft up and down.

        <desc>The ninja hero of the original Saboteur game has been killed, and his sister Nina is out to avenge this injustice. She has an array of kung-fu moves on offer, and must put them to use through 700 screens of action. The game design is very similar to the original, right down to the unusual background graphical style. The sections of the game are on multiple levels, separated mainly by ladders, and with lots of weapons and ammunition to pick up along the way. To beat the game you'll have to collect tapes and collect a 14-part computer code.

        <name>Saboteur! (48K)</name>
        <desc>Saboteur combines platform, beat 'em up and adventure elements, setting you as a lone samurai trying to infiltrate an enemy complex. You are capable of all manner of ninja-style moves including kicks and punches, as well as using weaponry. You must travel through an underground complex linked mainly by platforms and ladders, before triggering a bomb and escaping the complex. Your energy recharges if you stay still, so finding areas free of guards (kill these for money) and dogs (avoid them; killing them gains you nothing) is useful, especially as you only have one life. There's plenty of object manipulation involved, although only one item can ever be carried at a time.

        <desc>The ACG amulet (a reference to Ultimate's formal name of Ashby Computers and Graphics), has been split into four pieces, which are located in different parts of a jungle, and you're the intrepid explorer sent to locate them.

The game takes place on a thoroughly huge map, and the viewed area often includes section which overlap and can't be reached directly, due to the huge shrubs and trees which are used as borders.

The gameplay has many similarities to Ultimate's earlier Atic Atac title (even though they charged almost twice as much for it). It combines shooting (creatures such as spiders and hippos are among the many ferocious delights on show), and puzzle solving, largely involving manoeuvring objects. Once you run out of lives, the game tells you the percentage completed; chances are you'll be surprised that hours of exploration only cover half of it.

        <name>Sacred Armour of Antiriad, The (48K)</name>
        <desc>A passive and peaceful society established on Earth by the year 2086 has its idyllic existence shattered by an invasion of an alien attack force. The populace are sent to work in the aliens' mines. Some rebelled, but one stood out as the most hardy and courageous. Named Tal, he was instructed by the elders to explore the land in search of the legendary item which humans had worked so hard to perfect.

Once you've managed to get hold of the armour, the next problem is to seek out the various items which will make you even more magnificent - anti-grav boots, particle negator, pulser beam and implosion mine are the vital elements. The implosion mine is perhaps more important than any of the other items. This is the object needed to destroy the aliens' base.</desc>

        <desc>With the Roger Rabbit film (and game) successful, and the Jive Bunny phenomenon shaking up charts worldwide, perhaps it was time to redress the balance away from wimpy rabbits. Stan Sakai's comic character set in the 17th century did this, being capable of a range of martial arts moves. In this licensed game he'll need them to save Japan from being taken over by evil.

The game is side-scrolling and has large beat 'em up elements, but also incorporates Karma. Negative actions such as needless violence will be punished with a loss of Karma, while positives ones (such as bribing those who give Karma) are rewarded. When in combat, energy gauges display the condition of both yourself and your rival. Money collected can be spent on food for energy boosts.

        <desc>Sanxion is a side-scrolling shoot'em up where you fight your way through wave after wave of colourful enemies, using a futuristic looking aeroplane. The screen is divided in two, with one third at the top of the screen showing a bird's eye panoramic view of the surroundings and your plane, and the two thirds at the bottom showing the actual battlefield. The scrolling speed is controlled by the player, as the scrolling slows down when the plane nears the left side of the screen, and picks up speed as the plane moves towards the middle. Sanxion does not feature any end-bosses or power-ups, instead the player is treated to a non-lethal bonus stage after each completed level, where the aim is to shoot, collect or avoid obstacles in a race against time.

Contact with the enemies en route (which are mostly mutant demons) drains your limited energy, and you are also working against a time limit on each section. As well as your magical powers (which are stronger in part two), you can collect swords to attack, as well as lightning bolts which can be collected to destroy all enemies on screen. In part two vanquished foes release coins, which can be spent at shop sections on rechargers, shields and teleporters amongst other things.

        <desc>Savage contains three different parts, each with its own style. You can play all three, but to get more than one life on levels 2 or 3, you must first input the code earned on completing the previous level.

You play Savage, a muscular warrior who was imprisoned in a castle. When he broke free, he found out that his imprisonment had been a trick with the sole purpose of imprisoning his love, the maiden. You have to progress through the 3 parts of the game to rescue her. 

The first is a simple horizontal-scrolling shooter, in which you use the trajectory of your shots to kill enemies and collect the treasures and improved weapons they drop when killed. The second is a 1st person perspective 3D shooter resembling Space Harrier, with skulls to shoot and monoliths to avoid. In the third you play Savage's Eagle form, flying through platform-style levels avoiding timing-based hazards and shooting anyone who gets in your way. In this section bubbles can be shot to release power-ups

        <desc>This licensed platform games sets you as Scrappy Doo, with the aim of trekking through four levels to rescue Scooby and Shaggy. As his name suggests, Scrappy is adept at using his fists to vanquish many of these foes. The layout of the castle and the route to it features lots of ladders, ledges and gaps to negotiate. Bonus lives (via Scooby Snacks), invincibility periods and extra points (burgers) are on offer throughout the game. Many of these are in precariously-placed areas that require precise timing and considerable risk to reach.

        <desc>This game consists in disputing an exciting pinball game against a computer. But not a normal one, since its resources are unlimited and arranges of a huge army of mechanical exterminators ready to finish with us. The game objective is to lead a radioactive ball through 20 different boards full of dangers each one. On the left part of the screen we will find an indicator of radioactive energy that will be very important throughout the game, because, while the indicator is over half, we will be able to destroy the movable enemies when hitting against them, but if it is below this limit will not only not destroy the enemies, but in addition the firings of these will repel the trajectory of our ball. All the elements of the game have a specific utility and its knowledge is fundamental for trying to complete the route that will lead us to the last board.

        <desc>Sega's take on the 1943 style of vertically scrolling shoot 'em ups was set in the future. Your fighter plane is aged and under-powered, yet you must face down large planes,  tanks and ground targets to achieve victory. Each level ends with a close-viewed section of particular intensity before finally facing a boss. Smart bombs are occasionally found lying around, and can destroy everything on the screen, although you can't use them on the bosses. A simultaneous 2-player mode is provided.

When you find a clam, wait for its shell to open, then swoop down and grab your prize! Descend further, to find larger clams with bigger pearls. And if you go deeper still, you may find cave systems with ancient treasures to be taken. That is, if your oxygen holds out and you can get past the waving tentacles of the octopuses which guard these forbidden places!

Once you've taken as much as you can find, you'll have to make it back to the surface. Climb aboard your boat, offload your booty, then strap on a fresh oxygen tank and take to the waters once more.

        <desc>A surreal and very original game by Geoff Crammond.

The game plays out on a 3D landscape with hills and valleys made up of several levels. At the highest vantage point stands The Sentinel, a statue-like being with an energy draining stare, you begin at the lowest. "Energy" plays an important role, there's a constant amount in the game world and each object is worth a certain number of units - including you.

The object of each level is to absorb The Sentinel and Hyperspace to the next from his vantage point.</desc>

        <name>Shadow Dancer (128K)</name>
        <desc>Shadow Dancer is a one-player game in which you control Shinobi. With the help of your dog, you must kill your enemies while you venture through locations such as airports, railroads, waterfalls, sewers, and more.  Furthermore, you must find and disarm several bombs along the way before you leave each. You also have the option of using magic against enemies, which may consist of tornadoes or fireballs.

There are five missions you must complete; and each one has different objectives such as obstructing the enemies deadly mission, disrupting the enemy's supply route, raiding the enemy's industrial units, attacking the enemy's underground forces, and liberating and securing the shuttle's base. Each mission consists of three stages and there is a boss on each of the mission's final stages. 

What's good about the dog, you say? Well, if you tell it to, the dog will maul enemies (provided that the dog barks at them when you face them) and distract them long enough so that you can shoot at them. Remember that you have a limited time to do this, as the enemy will eventually kick the dog off him. This causes the dog to yelp and shrink, making him powerless against them.

        <name>Shadow Of The Beast (128K)</name>
        <desc>While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father.
As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.

Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the "very challenging" and the "impossible". The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.

        <name>Shadow Warriors (128K)</name>
        <desc>Shadow Warriors is a direct port of the arcade version of Ninja Gaiden. It is a beat'em up in the veins of Double Dragon featuring Ryu Hayabusa, a ninja who must fight members of an evil cult who seek to fulfil Nostradamus' end of the world prophecies.

Ryu Hayabusa can attack his enemies using his his bare hands and feet or using a sword (for a limited time). He can also perform moves such as a flying neck throw, a back flip and hang kicks, performed while hanging in scenario objects. Throwing enemies against objects such as phone cabins, oil drums or dumpsters will destroy them, revealing power ups such as health items and swords. At some points, Ryu will have to perform acrobatic moves to carry on. He has a life bar starting with 5 units.

The game takes place in United States' locations such as Las Vegas, North Carolina, Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon and Brooklyn. The enemies in those stages are mostly of the same 5 kinds, including Jason Vorhees' look-alikes and other masked men. There is a boss fight at the end of each stage.

A two-player co-operative game is also featured. Whenever the player dies, a continue screen will appear showing Ryu chained to a table while a circular saw descends upon him.

        <desc>Silent Shadow is an arcade with a small aerofighter as protagonist. The objective of the game is to get unharmed with maximum discretion a huge bomber to destroy the enemy fleet in the Persian Gulf. To do so the player has a modern and sophisticated fighter whose power, speed and ability can get to create false images on the radar, making it worthy of the Silent Shadow nickname.

To achieve the goal 4 phases must be overcome (airbase enemy, city, desert and the enemy fleet). The idea is not to depart too much from the bomber to avoid being hit by enemy fire, being destroyed and ending the game, but neither should you go too  slow because you could clash with the bomber, then losing the few opportunities you have. Expansionary pumps are available that can destroy all enemies in sight. The game allows collaborative game where up to 2 players can take one aerofighter.

        <name>Silkworm (128K)</name>
        <desc>Silkworm is a classic horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up based on the 1988 Tecmo arcade game. The main difference between this game and many other side-scrolling shoot-em-ups is that you got to be on land as well as in the air.

Player 1 would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joined the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a "goose" helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapons powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game (a "goose" could appear even during the end of level baddie!).

        <desc>SimCity sets you as the mayor of a new municipality, with the responsibility of building and maintaining a place where citizens can move to and work and be happy. The first task is to place essentials such as housing, transport links, schools, factories and shops. There are 50 types of these, allowing for homes of all standards and different types of businesses. Make sure to consider which sites are effective for which tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don't but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to ensure an income, and then portions allocated to public services such as policing and roads. Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.

Successful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that they need an airport to expand trade, or housing may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts of people come and leave.

The game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited scenarios, with specific challenges and targets. The environment varies in each game (especially if you have the Terrain Editor add on), and this should affect your choices.

        <desc>Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield.

On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough "proof" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.

The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.

Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.

        <desc>The whistle of the leaves with the wind of the forest is brutally interrupted by the appearance of a solitary figure between the branches of the shrubs. The sharping air of the North threat with tearing the clothes of the great horseman, "Sir Fred".  His rabid preoccupation for the kidnapping of the princess whom he loves does not appear reflected in his imperturbable expression. He only stops for a moment, with a fleeting blowing to fix, like an arrow, his glance on the walls of the castle and to tighten the teeth with desperation. He never faced so many and so big dangers. In each bend, in each stay of the great castle of Beni-Gómez it's awaiting him, threatening, the death. But there is no space for the doubt nor to lie down back. The decision is already taken. The ground runs, it almost flies under the firm and implacable push of his feet... 

Guide Sir Fred, through the different rooms of the castle, until finding his beloved princess. Take into account that she can be prisoner in different stays, and pay attention to the objects you can find on the way; they will help you to avoid the dangers which are distributed through all the adventure.

This means retrieving it from the headmaster's safe, by obtaining every piece of the pass-code from the teachers, by hitting each of the shields with your catapult.

All this has to be done around all the rigors of a typical school day. you must go to class when the bell goes, or else it's detention, and the other kids will often play around to block you. The game's Artificial Intelligence means that events continue to unfold around you in the other rooms and corridors.

        <desc>Adaptation du jeu d'arcade de Taito. Ce jeu est un Shoot'em up vertical à options. Les options se sélectionnent après avoir ramassé les étoiles sur les restes fumants des ennemis. On peut ainsi augmenter sa vitesse, la puissance de son tir, en ajouter un latéral, utiliser un laser, des missiles à tête chercheuse ou se protéger derrière un champs de force.
Comme tous ces shoot, un fois mort on redémarre "à poil". Il faut donc s'efforcer de tout faire en une seule vie si l'on veut terminer le jeu.
Petite particularité, ce jeu n'est pas divisé en stages, il se joue en discontinu jusqu'à la mort. Il se dit d'ailleurs dans le milieu que dans une salle d'arcade de Shibuya, un japonais y jouerait depuis 32 ans.</desc>

        <name>Slightly Magic (128K)</name>
        <desc>Slightly Magic is a platformer-adventure game not unlike Codemasters' own Dizzy and Seymour series, but is generally shorter and easier than most other games of that genre.

In Slightly Magic you are cast as Slightly - mischievous nephew of legendary wizard Bigwiz, who has suddenly taken off on some urgent business, leaving his castle in disarray with dragons and magical spells running amok. One of the dragons kidnaps the princess, and now Slightly has to save her.

In addition to standard inventory puzzles of Dizzy games, Slightly Magic introduces a magic system that requires multiple objects to be combined in order to achieve effects ranging from frightening the enemies to turning the player into a fish.

        <name>Sly Spy - Secret Agent (128K)</name>
        <desc>With a clear James Bond influence, Sly Spy must stop terrorists destroying parts of the city in this collection of sub-games. Roughly half of these (starting with level 2, and alternating from there on) are side-scrolling Green Beret-influenced offerings, not entirely dissimilar to a great many Ocean movie licenses. There are bad guys to shoot and bullets to avoid, with boxes to climb up on and strategic positions to shoot from behind cover.

The first level involves skydiving down the screen and shooting at the agents as they themselves fall - complete this and you'll safely parachute to the ground. There's a motorbike chase, in which you must shoot out and dodge agents. Two underwater levels follow, in which more enemies and some sharks must be shot. Before reaching the final multiple-enemy showdown in a missile factory full of the baddies from the game.

        <name>Smash TV (128K)</name>
        <desc>The year is 1999. The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.

        <desc>Soccer Pinball is a pinball game with eight round split across three tables. On the soccer-themed levels, a 'goal' is guarded by 'defenders' who must be removed by hitting them. Score three goals to reach the next level - initially you will face another soccer-based table with more defenders. Other football-themed elements include 'throw-in' positions from the side and pop-up players to toggle for points. 

On the Amiga version, the later tables have a casino and gambling as a theme. Gameplay is fundamentally the same - hit the correct targets in sequence to advance, with other targets adding to your score.

        <desc>Krillys has stolen the Zodiac Power Source and broken it into six pieces, and Sarnak has been sent to find it and hopefully rescue his friends Teron, Gorman and Tartarus. He travels through the Ebbedown Forest initially, with gameplay similar to Ghosts and Goblins. 

The journey is largely from left to right, although downward movements through gaps and upward movements on rotating platforms are also frequent. Some drops can be fatal, but mostly those which have a platform in close reach, so these are avoidable and not purely random. There are many magic teleports en route, and the high trees narrow the journey. Extra lives (via collecting 8 crystals) and improved weaponry are on offer throughout your quest.

Lots of extra weaponry can be collected along the way, although this is lost when one of your five lives is lost.

The planets Lagto, Cleemans and Cleemalt are all available for selection immediately. These each have their own settings – Cleedos is desert, Cleemalt cavernous and Lagto lush and verdant. After completing each planet you must successfully fly to the next one.

        <desc>Solomon's Key is a platform game with both action and strategy elements. On each level your goal is to retrieve a key which can then be used to unlock the exit. To help out, you have a magic wand which can be used to create and destroy blocks (though some blocks can't be destroyed). In order to reach the key you will need carefully to arrange the blocks on the screen so you can jump your way around safely. Wandering around each level are a variety of enemies which will cause you to lose a life if you're caught. Some creatures can be killed by destroying the block they are standing on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in blocks. Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit in which it must be completed.

Avoid evil ghosts and sorcerers, as they will drain your limited (but replenishable) energy. The final destination is Stonehenge, where the player must kill Necromancer using one of the three potential objects discovered during your journey.

        <desc>Set during the collapse of the Soviet Union, this arcade style game puts the player in control of a Soviet tank. This tank must explore the areas of Vilnius and Baku and rescue all Russian citizens. Meanwhile, the rebel armies will attack with everything they have.

The game uses an overhead view of the battlefield and multi-directional scroll. The gameplay is reminiscent of games like SWIV, but the need to rescue a certain number of hostages to complete the level adds a limited strategy element: the goal of the game is not to defeat the enemies, a task literally impossible as they re-spawn within seconds, but to rescue the hostages before being blown up.

        <name>Space Crusade (128K)</name>
        <desc>Space Crusade is a science fiction strategy game converted from the Games Workshop/Milton Bradley boardgame, in which you control a commander and four marines who are sent on different missions aboard hostile alien starships. Your commander starts off as a sergeant, but he can work his way through the ranks. The game allows three players, each commanding one marine chapter each. The alien team is `played` by the computer. 

The game is a literal conversion of the board game in the same vein as Gremlin's earlier Hero Quest. It can be best described as a turn-based board game in which the player must fulfill the primary and secondary objectives to complete the mission, which usually involves elimination of entire alien force on board or destruction of mothership etc. This game features unique 3D close-ups during the battle scenes, a feature which was later adopted by games like the X-Com series.

        <desc>Space Harrier II follows (very closely) in the footsteps of its predecessor and involves you (a Space Harrier) going off to save "Fantasy Land". This combined with the many flashing gaudy colors the game throws at you leads me to believe that it was born out of a bad acid trip.

There are 13 stages to complete by jetting around and blasting bad guys and bosses as they approach. The game is played from behind the main character and the landscape rushes up in 3D similar to the effect used in many car games such as Outrun.

The game uses many of the enemies and bosses from the first Space Harrier, but adds an array of new ones as well.

        <desc>A strange signal has crossed the Solar System, damaging the mining bases that the human being has dispersed through space. All the robots and auxiliary machines have gone crazy and any object that approaches them will be considered as objetive to eliminate.

Your mission will be to destroy the six generators that power these machines at each base avoiding that they can overheat, explode and produce a chain reaction that could eliminate the Earth. Once finished your mission you will be able to return home.

The enemies are indestructible, some of them may be paralyzed for a short period of time.

Good luck!</desc>

        <desc>Magic Knight's second game (after Finders Keepers) sees him travelling through time to rescue 8 people including his tutor Gimbal, who have become locked in time thanks to a faulty spell.

The game invented a whole new control system, essentially pioneering the use of icons and windows in adventure games. You control a pointing finger, which can be moved onto each of the menus to reveal sub-menus, which contain the main options for object manipulation. 

All objects can be examined in detail, which produces a visual display of them, and possible clues as to their usage. You must look after your character's health and energy levels - carrying too many objects will progressively weaken him. You must also look after and direct the trapped characters once you locate them.

        <desc>Solomon's Key is a clear conceptual influence for this action puzzler. Our hero must guide a ball through a level to the spot marked 'In', by creating and removing blocks to alter its path. The game is prevented from being a pure clone due to the ball, which moves automatically once activated, and can be controlled by using strategically-placed blocks.

Simply reaching the ball usually involves modifying the level layout using these bricks. There are enemies moving on fixed paths which must be avoided, and bonus items to collect. Also watch for bonuses such as invincibility, gravity-alteration and teleporting. You take time to rotate, so the controls aren't truly immediate. The ball takes 20 seconds to start moving, so use this time to plan ahead.

        <name>Spike in Transylvania (128K)</name>
        <desc>After a rough crossing of the North Sea, Spike the Viking is  washed ashore.  He ends up in Transilvania, which seems to be just an ordinary village.  However, he finds out that his shipmates have been captured, and are being imprisoned in the dungeons of the local castle.  Spike must rescue his friends from the mysterious castle, but first he has to escape from the (apparently friendly) villager's house where he finds himself, as the door won't open.

The game is a mix of puzzles and action.  The action involves you dodging various enemies, such as dogs, ghosts, bats, etc, and avoiding the many traps in the dungeons of the castle.

You only have a limited amount of energy, and if you lose all of it by touching enemies or traps, you lose a life.  If you lose all your lives you lose the game.

The puzzles, which are mostly fairly simple, involve both the use of objects, such as money to bribe a guard, and switches that perform various functions, such as deactivating traps.  

Keys are very important, as they are needed to unlock your shipmates' cells.  Some cells are protected by guards, who must be tempted away somehow to get to the cells they are guarding.

The game is viewed isometrically, which means that the controls are rotated through 90 degrees - this, coupled with the fact that many screens have huge gaps and diagonal paths, means that it's hard to get far at first. Falling off ledges loses you time, which is very limited to start with

Gerald must collect energy crystals throughout his journey - which can also be shortened by using a complex system of lifts. Sections you have travelled through are automatically mapped.

        <desc>Originating in the arcades, Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles). At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!). The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.</desc>

        <desc>M.A.D. magazine’s comic strip of the same name comes to life in this game which was designed for one or two players. The innovative split-screen shows both spies at the same time. Play with a friend or against the machine.

The black crow and the white crow are out to beat each other before the time bell rings. Find the needed objects by digging through drawers, closets and furniture in the house. Foil your opponent by setting creative booby traps in the various rooms (a bomb in a dresser drawer, for instance).

Fights ensue when both spies enter the same room.  Find hidden weapons in the rooms to help with those fights, since one of you will die if you run into each other.

        <desc>Ricky Steel is a feared renegade with a mechanical arm to fire bullets, and his Class A101 armoured yet amphibious Nightwind car is Stainless. He lives in a Mad Max-inspired world, but Dr. Vardos has sent a horde of androids to destroy it. Take control of Steel and stop this, in this Spy Hunter-style vertically scrolling road-based shooter. 

The game is split into four sections. You begin on foot, and must travel up the screen to reach the Nightwind. Helicopters and other foes must be shot or avoided, and their bullets avoided. You then enter your vehicle and drive up the screen, dealing with similar hazards. The controls involve pushing forward to accelerate and pushing down to reverse. Level 2 involves taking to the water, attacking submarines using bombs. The final showdown involves hunting down and killing Vardos, despite the attentions of animal-shaped asteroids and other hazards.

The scanner along the bottom of the screen is crucial to spotting foes as they approach. You have a limited shield, turned on and off by pressing space, and limited fuel which is recharged by collecting fuel circles which float by.

        <desc>Star Bowls es la segunda parte de Nuclear Bowls, uno de los primeros juegos lanzados al mercado por Zigurat.

Años después del lanzamiento del original, Diabolic (el grupo de programación) nos sorprendió con esta secuela de extraordinaria calidad, cuyo único pecado fue, seguramente, haber sido programado fuera de tiempo, en una época en la que el concepto de juego estaba cambiando y donde este tipo de programas apenas despertaba interés entre los usuarios.</desc>

        <desc>The Star Firebirds are a dangerous alien race which must be wiped out before they can attack your people. This makes for a shoot 'em up with your ship at the bottom of the screen, shooting upwards as it dodges the Firebirds as they shoot down the screen. To clear each of the 64 waves you must destroy a set amount of each of the two types of Firebirds. 

You have a standard cannon as well as a hyperspace super-move, which can wipe out several Firebirds at once. Each wave finishes with a super-baddy to be shot several times in between its efforts at raining shots down on you.

        <desc>The Tasty Space Griffin, a rare, bird-like creature, is considered a delicacy and has acquired great value. On the moon of a distant planet, mercenaries have been secretly breeding the Tasty Space Griffin and plan to flood the market in order to destabilize it, which they hope will allow them to seize power. Because of an error on part of the notoriously unreliable series seven astroplex, the task to destroy this evil plot rests in the paws of the ill-prepared Captain Rover Pawstrong.

Players take control of Pawstrong and must help him chase and kill all 20 Space Griffins on (and below) the surface of the moon. The looping playing area is presented from a side-scrolling perspective, with the bottom of the screen showing  a radar indicating the position of Pawstrong and the Space Griffin he is chasing. Pawstrong's health is represented by a cooked Griffin which disappears over time, but gets replenished when a Griffin is caught. The most straight forward and least effective way to catch a Space Griffin is to simply jump on it. It is advisable however, to use some of the items that can be picked up from boxes randomly dropped on the moon's surface by a spaceship. These items include transportation devices like anti-gravity pads or rockets, weapons such as rocket launchers or explosives and food that replenishes some of Pawstrong's health. A mining lamp is needed to see inside the mines under the surface of the moon. Here, Pawstrong can also pick up ammunition for his weapon. When he finds and uses a matter transporter, he is taken to a different part of the moon from where he can attack The Space Griffin with his catapult-style weapon. Finally, a bonus puzzle can be found which requires the player to rearrange a picture, similar to Split Personalities, within a time limit.

In the first phase you have to pass swarms of TIE Fighters, including dogfighting the one piloted by Darth Vader himself. In the second phase the station's surface is protected by laser towers, third involves attacking its weakest spot - the unprotected exhaust port - with proton torpedos. Your X-Wing starts with six shields, but more can be awarded for good performance. Complete the game and it loops back around at ever-increasing difficulty.</desc>

        <desc>The Planet Novenia has been attacked by the Egrons, who snuck in by disguising their craft as the protected Starglider species, which Novenia's automated defenses were programmed not to shoot. 

Your task is to fight them off using only an obsolete Airborne Ground Attack Vehicle. This was designed as the ultimate combat machine, with sophisticated hardware up to Draziw Yarg's high standards. It has a fully-rechargeable shield, plasma drive unit, an inbuilt scanner and 10,000-sector map, a top speed of 2550 Urads and two homing missiles.

The game is viewed from within AGAV's cockpit, with control over speed, weapon targeting and firing. There are several control options to decide exactly how the craft works, with fixed or floating sighting, and the option of automatic centering, allowing you to balance the game between easy sighting and advanced shooting ranges.

Repair depots must be visited frequently, as they can refill the weapon bays as well as repairing the ship. Crucially, the Egron Stargliders need 3 missiles to shoot down, so at least 1 visit to a depot is required to complete this job, at which point you move up to the next, harder, level.

        <desc>More space combat and strategy in this sequel, which challenges you to collect the elements to form a bomb to destroy a resistance force, before delivering them through heavy fighting. Each planet has its own characteristics, with differing inhabitants and features. 

As well as flying through space, you must dart through tunnels under the planets, which restricted your movement range but are where most of the weapons are. As you go along you'll have to obtain objects from people, and trade them so as to be able to complete your main objectives.

The biggest advance from the original Starglider was seen as the polygon graphics, which are filled on 16-bit systems, and contain considerable detail.

        <desc>As BLOB, the Bio-Logically Operated Being, you are sent into an unstable planet and charged with the task of preventing it from exploding. This involves collecting various items (the exact combination is different every time you load the game) and taking them to the planet's core.

The game is an arcade adventure viewed from the side, with 512 screens arranged in a 16x32 pattern. A teleport system exists, so once you find the codes you can get quick access to different parts of the game.

The creatures to avoid are intelligent, getting tougher to predict as you get closer to the centre, but you are armed with a gun and can also try to avoid them. BLOB has a set of platforms which can be used to allow limited vertical movement, but these disappear after a few seconds each use.

        <desc>Steg the slug has to feed his family of "T'yungunz".  To do this he must blow bubbles to catch the grubs that they feed on and guide them through the level by blowing on them or nudging them past any obstacles in the way to the nest where T'yungunz live.  To complete a level, you must make sure that a certain number of T'yungunz are fully fed so they go to sleep.  If they don't get enough food then eventually they die.

The levels are full of contraptions such as bellows, and obstacles such as spikes and fire that will burst the bubbles.  Some of these can be activated or deactivated using various switches.

Usually Steg navigates each level by walking on the floor, and also he can climb up the walls and even walk on the ceiling.  There are also devices he can contruct out of the parts from the Acme Bionic Bitz Catalogue, such as the Rocket Pack, and Bionic Legs, which allow different ways of getting around each level.

        <desc>The ITA Express is under the control of the vicious Redmen, and cannot be allowed to continue its momentum. This is where you come in as a Security Guard, as you start on top of the final carriage of the train and must walk across it, jumping over the gaps, to reach the front. Redmen must be kicked into oblivion with a precise contact before they can throw you off the train; they will also throw knives, which must be ducked. 

You can turn the tables thanks to the Snakebird, which will pick you up if you jump into it, and allow you to drop on top of a Redman. You have a limited amount of time to reach the front, indicated by the ground moving backwards as the train moves forwards. In the second part of the game you are inside the train, trying to survive long enough for the whole thing to begin again with increased difficulty.

        <desc>Stormbringer is the fourth and final game to star Magic Knight, and the only one to make it onto 16-bit systems. Magic Knight must meet with his alter-ego, the Off-White Knight, by reaching his castle hideout - which means clearing 64 screens of adventure.

As with the rest of the series, the game uses a largely visual system, in which a press of the fire button calls up a menu of options, such as 'examine', 'pick up' or 'cast spell. Selecting these calls up a sub-menu to choose what should be examined or thrown, which objects to combine, which spells to cast, and so on. The objects to be used include a chicken, a disguise and eggs. One new feature is that bolts of lightning are fired down at Magic Knight from the sky, and these must be avoided.

Moosh didn't take kindly to Tyche's offers of peace and a bridge for trade between their worlds, and so destroyed the bridge, and in a final daring move kidnapped Tyche before returning to his own world and throwing him in jail.  A better bridge, so much more secure than it's predecessor, now spans the worlds allowing his henchmen to carry the minerals, oils and precious gems back from Tyche's once free lands, with the citizens enslaved to toil for Moosh's greed.

But the resistance is growing, and if only their leader was back amongst them they could start to fight against the tyranny.  And so - with his trusty staff smuggled into the prison - Tyche has escaped his captors and must start to make the journey home...</desc>

        <desc>You are Ryu, a Street Fighter. Your goal is to travel to 5 countries (Japan, USA, England, China and Thailand) and beat 2 enemies at each of them. Many of these characters, such as Adon, Gen, and Birdie, are later seen in the Street Fighter Alpha series.

After each country you will have the chance to get additional points in a little bonus round, a feature seen later in most Street Fighter games. 

The final boss in the game is Sagat, who is the second to the last boss in Street Fighter 2. The goal is to become the greatest fighter in the world. As with most tournament fighting games once you have defeated the boss the game will reset and start from the beginning with a harder difficulty level. 

It is possible to start a two player game but there will be only one fight (between the two players) which will determine who will travel the globe to fight the computer controlled opponents.

        <name>Street Fighter II (128K)</name>
        <desc>The original Street Fighter II is a famous fighting game. Players select from one of eight characters: Ryu, Ken, Blanka, E. Honda, Zangief, Chun Li, Guile and Dhalsim to do battle with. They must then use their combat strengths to defeat the other seven fighters followed by four boss characters: M. Bison, Vega, Sagat and Balrog. Each character represents a certain country and has their own reasons for wanting to win against the others.

Each character contains his own selection of basic fighting techniques based on three styles of punches and three styles of kicks. The effect of each of these changes depending on the characters orientation (ducking, airborne or standing still). Street Fighter 2 made famous the "button combination" style of gameplay used to unleash powerful moves specific to each character. These include the ability to project fireballs, channel electricity or capture the opponent in a tight suplex.

Street Fighter 2 is one of the most cloned fighting games and its effects on gameplay and fighting games specifically can not be understated. Street Fighter 2 is responsible for making popular several different elements.

Using your sword, you must flatten Trogan's many henchmen, and avoid skeletons. You have limited energy, but can collect top-ups. Tokens to both improve and weaken your weaponry are also scattered throughout.

The Amstrad version adds a silhouetted backdrop (similar to that in the C64 version) when ran on the Amstrad Plus, making it the only cassette-based game released in the UK to cater to the system.

        <desc>Stuntman Seymour is a side-scrolling platform game. The protagonist, Seymour, as a stuntman must make his way through four movie sets with different themes. 

There are numerous enemies on each level, and collision with an enemy or its projectile, or falling into water causes Seymour to lose a life (he has 5 of them). Seymour can defend himself by shooting bullets that travel forward, or tossing bombs that fly directly upwards and then fall (there's a limited amount of bombs, but more can be collected on the way.) The levels also have score-giving items to collect. At the end of each level, Seymour fights a giant boss that jumps around and tosses bombs.

        <name>Subbuteo - The Computer Game (128K)</name>
        <desc>Subbuteo recreates the famous table football game, which makes for something very different from Sensible/Kick Off/FIFA style games. It's effectively a turn-based strategy game of sorts, as each player has 30 seconds to make their move (within a 30 minute match length), which involves first selecting a player, then aiming the direction in which he will be flicked, then the power and swerve of the flick are determined by the length of time the button is held down for. 

With any luck, your player will hit the ball, and hit it such that it doesn't leave the playing area, and doesn't hit an opponent. If any of those rules are violated, possession passes to the opposition. Before each flick, the team not in possession can make a 'defensive flick' involving moving one of their players into a potential blocking position (without hitting the ball or an opponent, as this is a foul).

        <desc>This is a top-view racing game, stylistically influenced by Super Sprint, from the company who later produced the Lotus series of games.

There are 9 tracks at each of the 4 difficulty levels, which can be raced in any order (although the last track you race is made harder than usual). In the races you win money, which can be spent on the usual handling and power upgrades, as well as forward-shooting missiles. You must finish in the top 3 of each race to progress - initially there are 4 computer opponents, but more are added as you progress through the game

You can upgrade your car throughout the game via the shop section. You are given an initial price, but also a number of options of things to say to the salesman – get the right combination and the price will drop.

There are 3 skill levels, which affect the amount of time you have to complete the level, and the bonus offered if you manage to (the amount of time left, divided by a set number, bigger on lower levels). Your bike has 3 gears and appears to have a top speed of around 120 MPH. After every 2 races there's a bonus round in which you must pick up as many tokens as possible in the time limit.

To get back to safety, he'll have to navigate the Sea of Dreams and its nightmarish hordes of alien beings. Contact with rock faces, landmines or those aliens will cost you a life. You are armed with a laser and your Jetpac, which will need recharges of ammunition and fuel - these are dotted along the jagged surface and will require precise positioning to retrieve. There are several teleports along the surface, which will advance you a short way through the level.

        <desc>This is a conversion of Sega's popular motorcycle racing arcade game.  In this game you race a motorcycle around the world, completing each section of track within a time limit. There are other bikes on the road, but beating this is not important, so they can be thought of as moving obstacles. Each continent is a different difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is junior, the Americas are senior, and Europe is expert.  

This is a very simple and straightforward game, viewed from behind the bike in 2D (so the screen does not tilt with the bike). The right/left controls are steering, and up/down are gear changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or running off the road slows the bike down.

Your cycle is always moving, and your speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or running off the road slows the bike down.

Lots of goodies have been hidden around the worlds to help you, ranging from swords and Power Boots to advanced ones such as Teleport Keys and an ESP Gauge, which guides you direction-wise. Many of these are only visible once you have the helmet. 

After each Guardian dies you get a Deadzone bonus level, which can earn you an extra life if you escape unscathed. An advanced player status screen is included.

As well as the famous Monaco course, others from around the world have been added, to give the game a longer shelf life. You must complete qualification sessions and the races as fast as possible.

The Genesis version of Super Monaco adds a complete career mode, however.  In the career mode, your goal is to win a season of races. Unfortunately, you start with a relatively slow car.  By challenging other drivers, you can move to a better team and car, and ultimately win the F1 World Title.

Gameplay is flick-screen and platform-based. Spiders and guards' darts must be avoided - contact with these drains your energy from its initial 99, as does falling any distance, although health tablets can be collected. Hearts must be collected from each screen, as must keys to operate the medieval lifts.

The game uses a split-screen display, with a big window viewed from the side as well as a longer-range aerial view - the latter is useful for dodging hazards to the left or right, as the side-view doesn't demonstrate these accurately. The bike has 3 gears, and you must use a low gear to go uphill. You will need to do wheelies to ensure good landings from the big jumps, and to clear divots in the ground.

One barrel at a time is highlighted and is worth more points than the others, but will explode after a short countdown. Seymour is plagued by mutants which fly and bounce around the screen. Some must be jumped on from above, some must be hit from below.

Occasionally wrenches will appear in the roadway, and when collected they can be used after a race to power up your car with better tires, better acceleration or a higher top speed.

The scenes include desert chases, forest rallying and Grand Canyon jumps. There are 7 levels in total, each teeming with ‘bad guys’ and scenery obstacles. You score points for each enemy you shoot down. 

Unusually, you get bonuses for crashing anything up to twice (as this can be perceived to maximize the action stakes for the film), but a third crash means Game Over.

        <desc>8 challenging zones of battle await you in your role as a tank driver. The game is viewed from above, with rotational control and forward/reverse power for the tank. The routes to travel along are narrow and varied, so some exploration is required – some paths are inevitably safer and faster than others. The walls are particularly useful as they are strong enough to deflect shots, so you can often attack from safe positions round a corner.

Opposition includes gun turrets firing at you, enemy tanks and landmines. You start with a standard gun, which must be held down longer to take out tougher foes, but can collect smart bombs and shields. A first-person viewpoint section follows each of these sections, with the sighting under your control, and more helicopters and jeeps to take on.

At the end of every track the road forks and the player can choose the next stage in their route. This feature, taken from Sega's "OutRun", makes every trip a new challenge.

The gameplay is platform and ladders based, set both inside and outside. The layout of the territories becomes visible as you progress, and they can contain bonus weapons and secret rooms. Unlike the sequel you start without weaponry, and this is gained directly, rather than you collecting coins and trading them at shop sections. Holding down fire progressively builds up your fighting power.

One player controlled a helicopter and the other a jeep, with the jeep transforming into a boat when the vehicles passed over water. As well as a host of blaster fodder the game also included a mid-level enemy inspired by the "Goose" enemy from the earlier title Silkworm. Pieces of this enemy would fly onto the screen and assemble into one vehicle before commencing to fire at the players' vehicles. When destroyed the "goose" would drop power-ups.

        <desc>Vincent Ratatoui isn't nice - EDAM well stole the world's cheeses, and did a GOUDA job of it, making the world a GRUYERE place. Tai-Chi Tortoise goes EMMENTAL, and sets off to retrieve it all. He must travel CAERPHILY through over 100 screens of platform and ladders action, but he's no BABYBEL, and his martial arts training makes him FETA than most, so it can be done.

Plenty of objects must be collected en route, and put to use - things such as a spade and jump shoes. Some of the ledges can be stood on, while others disappear when you stand on them (though they all regenerate if you leave and re-enter the screen)

        <desc>According to African legend, a human baby was abandoned in the forest. Found and brought up by a she-ape named Kala, he grew to learn the ways of the jungle and the language of the beasts. Years later, as John Clayton, Lord of Greystoke, he was brought back to England to claim his rightful inheritance. However, he occasionally returns to the wild to become Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle.

Now is one of those occasions. Tarzan has returned to the jungle with his wife, Lady Jane Greystoke, but their holiday came to an end when Usanga, evil chief of the Wamabo, kidnaps Jane to force Tarzan into retrieving the seven gemstones that were stolen from his tribal shrine. These gemstones are believed to be the Eyes of the Rainbow, representing each color of the spectrum. Tarzan has been given three days to find the gemstones, otherwise Jane will be eaten by the tribal pet, Sheeta the Panther.

After consulting his information sources, Tarzan learns that the Eyes of the Rainbow have been scattered around the dense jungle by a family of pesky chimps. Tarzan's quest involves navigating dark caves, crevasses, swamps, and treacherous quicksand. 

Objects, such as the rope and torch, need to be found if Tarzan wants to find each gemstone. Throughout the quest, hazards such asheadhunters, lions, snakes, spiders, quicksands, and pits are encountered. If Tarzan comes into contact with any of these hazards, he becomes stunned for an hour and the on-screen timer shrinks accordingly. Fortunately, he can punch creatures, allowing him to escape them.

If Tarzan manages to find all seven gemstones within the time limit and deliver them to Usanga, Jane will be released. If not, she will become nothing more than another bowl of jungle soup.

        <desc>You play Tarzan, who the witch doctor has turned into a monkey. To change back to his human form,  you need to collect six ingredients - necklace, mask, plant, crossbones, a bottle, and gem - and place them in his cauldron. While you are doing this, you deal with various forms of wildlife; such as snakes, birds, lizards, and cannibals; by stoning them to death. Fruit can be picked up for bonus points. There are two types of skulls that are scattered through each level.  One that gives you reverse controls, and one that causes loss of life. When Tarzan has obtained all six ingredients, you proceed onto the next level. In between these, you play a bonus level where the object is to collect a number of gems before time runs out.

        <desc>With April O'Neil held hostage by The Shredder's thugs, Bebop and Rocksteady, once again, it's up to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to come to her rescue!  Play as all four of the turtle heroes, rescue April, and then rescue your sensei Splinter from Mecha-Turtles clutches than go after The Shredder deep in the bowels of The Technodrome itself.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an action game based on the late eighties/early nineties cartoon series of the same name. Play as Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael (one turtle only, but the ability to swap between turtles at any time) as you save your friends and battle The Shredder and his cronies. There are no 'lives', as such - when you lose a turtle, he becomes 'captured', and you cannot use him again until you rescue him from a place hidden in the overworld.

Gameplay takes place in two perspectives: a top-down view, which lets you run around and explore buildings, sewers and other places. When entering places from the top-down view, the perspective shifts to a side-scrolling view, where most of the battling takes place. In addition to each turtle's main weapon, sub-weapons (such as shuriken) can be acquired, to use at foes - these have a limited use.

There are over 100 screens to fly through, and they include many barriers and narrow paths, as well as force fields. There are also time-shift fields - some move you forward, but some send you back to the start.

Enemies are in short supply - the game's feel resembles Artificial Dreams (from the same designer). You have limited fuel and must collect fuel tokens to recharge this. Other available powerups include points bonuses, extra lives, changes to the constant speed of scrolling, and invincibility from force fields (although not enemies).

The action is viewed from above, scrolling only at the top, leaving you with a set journey to follow. You are limited to 2 bullets on screen at a time, so each shot should be tactically considered.

Power-ups are released by numbered buildings - shoot the building and then fly immediately in front of it to collect them. Once you have a a power-up Formation Mode, which gives you multiple firing positions as the ship splits of itself, is an option.

        <desc>Like perennial license favourite Thunderbirds, Terrahawks was written by Gerry Anderson, featured puppets, and was set in space. It is this latter element that the licensed game is built around, as you aim to pass Terrahawk Pilot Training.

To succeed, you must be able to deal with a black hole, which will take amazing thought and reaction speed. Having been sucked in you must fly through the vortex, reaching it by shooting out the monoliths which block your path. You must be careful not to collide with these more than 5 times, as that is all your shield can withstand. Also, avoid running out of fuel by flying as low among the monoliths as you can - the higher line is safer but consumes fuel much faster. There are 9 stratums of increasing difficulty to survive.

        <desc>The original commercially-licensed version of Alexey Pajitnov's classic Tetris puzzle game.  Geometric shapes fall from the top of a playfield to rest on the bottom; fit the pieces together, and the line they form disappears.  If the pieces don't form lines and eventually stack up to the top of the playfield, the game is over.  Difficulty increases by dropping the pieces faster and faster over time.

Tetris is a verifiable classic game, translated to well over 200 electronic and computer platforms.  It takes 2 minutes to learn, but a lifetime to master.

        <name>Tetris 2 (128K)</name>
        <desc>Take basic Tetris, add a few refreshing ideas with possibility of 2 players game and you have Tetris 2.

Menu of the game offers 2 modes - "Normal Tetris" and "Tetris 2".

First mode isn't nothing more than classic tetris. Geometric shapes randomly generated from 7 basic kinds fall from the top to the bottom. The aim is to form these shapes into coherent
horizontal 1,2,3 or 4-lines so they will disappear. This mode offer various rates of falling shapes. Also, it's possible to switch on another 7 special kinds of shapes.

Second mode is much more interesting. There is 99 different rounds prepared. Almost each round is partly filled with some diagram created by particular shapes (which of course increases difficulty of the game). Every round contains objective(s) to complete. 3 kinds of objectives does exist - "Fulfill Your Quota", "Destroy All Bricks" and "Survive xx Seconds". If you'll fail, you're advancing to the next round with loss of 1 life. But no worries, each 5th round is bonus and you can obtain extra life. As well as the first mode it's possible to play with 7 basic kinds of shapes or with 7 basic+7 special kinds of shapes.

        <desc>This place would indeed be paradise, were it not for the fact that the Can Nibbles inhabit it. Herbert and Wilma Week are trapped by them, so Wally has become the third Week in paradise in his attempt at rescuing them.

This is an arcade adventure resembling the other Wally Week games, although it represents David Perry's design debut. There are many animals to avoid including stinging bees and butterflies, but the toughest foe is the Indian chief, best avoided with a well-timed jump. There are multi-stage puzzles to solve on each screen, and a limit of carrying 2 objects at a time.

The setting is largely jungle, but there are forests, beaches and huts amongst other things to explore as well. Movement between screens is generally from left to right, but you will go into the screen via signposted sections, and occasionally travel vertically as well.

        <desc>Aboard the lethal Gunship Gladiator helicopter, it is your job to ensure that a coup fails to install a dictator as leader. 

The game features 12 levels split into three distinct styles. First of all you'll be flying over a city in your helicopter, shooting out tanks by ducking low enough to target them, but also climbing to avoid the skyscrapers in the area. The third section is viewed similarly, but sees you attempting to wipe out the planes mounted on an aircraft carrier.

The second section is viewed behind your helicopter in full 3D, and adds helicopters and planes to be shot, with dodging their bullets as you duck down to shoot the tanks being the main challenge.

        <desc>International Rescue is made up of George Tracy, Brains Hackenback, and Tracy's five sons, each of whom has a Thunderbird craft of their own. They have four missions to complete in turn.

Each of these involves a two-man squad, whom you can switch between at any time. Each must select the correct objects to bring beforehand. You will have to move through the screens via lifts and ladders, avoid hazards and solve puzzles.

Mission one is set in a mine shaft, which is rapidly flooding and has two miners trapped. Next up is a nuclear submarine stranded after hitting a mine, which must be repaired and reactivated before it explodes. During this mission, you discover evidence of the miner's construction, so must break into a bank to steal the appropriate documents. This reveals that a madman is holding International Rescue to ransom, so you must finally travel to his lair to stop him.

Although you start with only a sword, more can be collected by attacking the various containers through the levels - later weapons can destroy these enemies quicker, and allow attacks from a distance. Reaching the end of each level sees bonuses for time and kills. The path through the game can be varied on later levels, so you can play it through more than once and find new sections, even though the individual levels only scroll left-to-right.

Most enemies are easy to attack and only need one hit to kill, although they come at you in large hordes. Once you get to the indoor sections you will find big enemies with the ability to kill you with one hit, in sections set on multiple levels complete with stairways.

        <desc>In Time Machine, the player takes control over Professor Potts whose main profession is building time machines. As terrorists bomb his laboratory, he gets sucked ten million years into the past. During the course of his adventure he will visit five time zones with five screens each.

This is an adventure with action elements. Most of the game is spent manipulating objects in the different time zones which have an effect on a later zone, e.g. planting a seed in the stone age will cause a tree to appear in the later zones. He also may need to bring an object from one time to another. In each zone there is one big puzzle to solve in order to get access to the next zone (the ultimate goal is to prevent the time machine from getting destroyed), but constant traveling between the time zones is necessary.</desc>

        <desc>Hergé's famous cartoon character is brought to life in this multi-stage action game, specifically based around the episode of the same name. In many details the story was similar to the real moon landings, then many years off. 

A more accurate title for the game would be 'Tintin Gets to the Moon', as reaching it is your challenge. The game is split into two distinct types of sections; the first of these involves guiding the rocket through space. Steer it to avoid contact with asteroids, and to collect eight red spheres. Yellow spheres boost energy, and so should be collected.

This is followed by a platform-based battle, as the evil Captain Jurgen has tied up several crew members, planted time bombs, and started several fires. Use your extinguisher on Jurgen and the fires, and touch the bombs and crew members to solve those problems. Turn gravity off to reach the more troublesome bombs.

        <desc>Top Cat is in Beverly Hills to track down Benny the Ball and prevent him gaining the contents of a will that is not rightly his, and find the rightful heiress. 

The game is a top-down puzzler of sorts. An object manipulation mode is used to pick up and use objects when necessary. Extra milk (for energy) and fruit (for points) can be collected. Skateboarders must be avoided as they can take objects and randomly move them.

The members of your gang must all be gathered up on the first level, and must be kept on your side by ensuring that your energy doesn't drop too low.

The plane flies forward automatically and can only be moved up or down. The goal is to shoot enemy planes, based on German World War II planes like the Heinkel He-111. For each next level more planes need to be destroyed. Along the way various bonuses can be collected, providing more firepower or an extra life, but they power-up icons can be destroyed by accident when they are shot.</desc>

        <desc>Based on the movie of the same name, Total Recall puts you in charge of Douglas Quaid, who must find a way to Mars in order to find the answers to his two questions: why is he being hunted, and who is hunting him. In order to do this, Quaid must go through level after level of beating up bad guys that get in his way.

Some of the levels differ in gameplay, and range between action and driving scenes. The action scenes mainly require you to collect some items before leaving the level. You have only one chance to complete the current level, which means that if your energy is lost, the game ends. Energy is lost if you are attacked by an obstacle, or if you are shot at by an enemy. You can gain more energy by either collecting some pills or a heart, depending on the platform.

        <name>Toyota Celica GT Rally (128K)</name>
        <desc>A detailed recreation of rallying licensed from Toyota Great Britain. Driving on gravel, asphalt and ice is involved, with each race made up of a series of short stages to complete. After each stage, your times are compared with those of your rivals, whose names are subtly changed from the real drivers of the day. Up to four human players can be involved, taking it in turns.

As visibility is sometimes low, and the exact curvature of a corner isn't always obvious from the apex, a co-driver is provided to give pace notes. These can be adjusted before you take to the track, specifying what is defined as 'hard left' and how early the warning should be given.

The steering sensitivity can be adjusted, and you can choose between automatic centering, and a push-the-opposite-way-to-centre mode, but more unusual is the option to race with the steering directions reversed - definitely one for advanced players.

        <desc>In the months before France is liberated by the Allies in World War 2, Germany tries to take Paris' collection of classic paintings. As Resistance member Pierre LeFeu, helped by wounded former engineer Le Duc, must prevent this happening, but taking the paintings by train to Normandy and Allied control.

Once in control of the train, you must set the throttle level, ensure that there is enough coal in the furnace, control the speed, and ensure that steam is released when necessary. Use the provided map, and the communications network once released, to plan the strategic side of your mission. Each station has coal and water supplies which may be needed to keep the train running.

You must raid railway stations in order to get track switches into the right position. Both this and the initial capture of the train involve aiming at the enemy, current indicated point, and ducking before their bullets can hit you. Taking control of bridges is similar - you control a cannon and must take aim.

Fuel is in short supply, and you must drive over one of the fuel pumps to refill. Contact with trees costs you a life, as does contact with the Black Patrol Cars. The gameworld has an invisible border, which causes the car to reverse automatically, so watch out that this doesn't cause a crash. There is a map at the side of the screen, which locates the fuel and your car, but obviously not the Cups.

        <name>Trap Door, The (48K)</name>
        <desc>Berk is trying to obtain a chest of treasure from within a castle inhabited by the Bad Tempered Thing. This involves completing five tasks, although a learner mode in which only 4 are required is also provided. The first task is to provide a can of worms, whilst crushed eyeballs must be provided for task two. You then need to boil Slimies, fry eggs (getting them is a dilemma in itself), and then force everything back into the trapdoor. These tasks must be completed before Thing’s Angry Meter reaches its limit.

As fans of the TV show will recall, the Trap Door of the title seals in numerous strange monsters, and in the game some are harmful and some are a hindrance, depending on the task at hand, so be careful which ones are released. Remember to close it, as spooks will be released if you do not – these require food to be pacified. Boni and Drutt appear regularly – the former giving cryptic morsels of advice, and the latter eating spiders and getting in the way. You can prepare for one task while completing another, so pay attention to items which may be useful, and think about what they are likely to be used in conjunction with.

        <desc>While few young people aspire to the role of a Dustman, New Generation Software felt they would enjoy pretending to be one on this innovative arcade game.

Each section presents you with a road of houses, drawn from forced-perspective 3D, with flick-scrolling as you move up the road. Each house's dustbin must be collected, emptied and replaced within the time limit, which is indicated by the Bonus timer at the top of the screen. If this reaches zero, you receive the first of 3 warnings -  a third sees you out of a job.

Setting foot on the grass causes the onus to drop more quickly, and there are additional hazards to avoid, including the local cars, which appear to be driven by maniacs, and cyclists and barking dogs, which can both injure you and cause your movement to slow.

        <name>Turbo Cup Challenge (128K)</name>
        <desc>Based on sportscar and Paris-Dakar racer René Metge and his Porsche 944 Turbo, Turbo Cup is a racing game viewed from above and behind the car, in a forced perspective. Instead of the sand of the Dakar race, the game features four conventional French racetracks - Paul Ricard, Nogaro, Magny-Cours and Dijon-Prenois. 

After completing a qualifying lap you race against 21 similar cars. Contact with cars from behind causes you to spin but does not affect your rival, although side-on contact is usually beneficial. There are hazards off the track to avoid, and hitting the grass at speed causes a spin.

        <desc>The sequel to OutRun features similar basic gameplay to the original, with the action viewed from behind the car, and the challenge being to complete each stage within the time limit. Contact can cause the car to spin, slow down or even flip; in each case you will lose time.

There are 16 stages set across the US, gradually moving from east to west, all depicted differently visually. After every 4 levels, you go into a shop screen, with a choice of upgrades. As the title implies, you now have a turbo booster installed, which speeds up the car, although over-use can cause the engine to overheat, and it is not recharged until each shop section. You have 5 continues, and failure to complete the course within the time limit costs you one.

        <desc>After Doctor Mulliner and his assistant Beckett make a mistake using Cybernetic technology prototypes, Mulliner’s pet tortoise Wal is given super powers. The only way a working machine can be built is for this tortoise to travel through time and collect the required parts from six time periods (Prehistoric, Ice Age, Egyptian, Mediaeval, 20th Century and the Future).

Taking the role of Turbo the Tortoise, the player must travel through six side-scrolling platform levels, each of them well-guarded by enemies. Limited weaponry can be collected, although jumping on the heads of these foes will also kill them. Turbo must allow for moving platforms, switches, fragile platforms and water hazards. Enhancements and extra lives are in hard-to-reach places, often only accessible by using enemy heads as launch pads.

Gameplay is conceptually simple: just jump, shoot and explore. However, this game puts a lot of emphasis on finding and using the 10 different weapons Turrican can collect.

        <name>Turrican II (128K)</name>
        <desc>Turrican II: The Final Fight is a platformer/shooter as typically seen on consoles, but designed for home computers from the ground up.

Its plot is - naturally - very simple: an evil mega-robot called The Machine attacks the United Planets Ship Avalon 1, slaughtering all who resist. All - except Bren McGuire, who manages to escape and slips into the experimental Turrican bionic armor. As Turrican, he strives to show The Machine who's the boss.

Unlike other games of its type, this game contains three levels of horizontal shooter action in the spirit of R-Type or the developers' own Katakis. Six large worlds are to be explored, where you are basically free to go everywhere you want, since there is no automatic scrolling and the levels are packed with hidden extra lives and weapons. All those levels are very different: the first one in the rock desert is pretty colorful with parallaxing rainbow background and happy music, while the following worlds get darker and darker.

Turrican can get some different weapons for his arm cannon:

1. The bounce weapon which rebounds from surfaces into smaller bouncing balls when powered up;
The laser, which can shoots beams as large as Turrican himself when maxed out;
 the multiple shot beam, which can shoot up to five beams covering approximately a 90 degree angle.

 
The Turrican suit weaponry is not limited to the arm cannon however:

1. He also can fire a continuous beam, activated by holding the fire button. This beam can be rotated around Turrican, so it is possible to blast things below him in this way;
Additionally, he can fire power lines by pressing the space bar, resulting in two energy bars as high as the screen going from the Turrican suit to the left and right of the screen, severely damaging enemies in the process;
If the space bar is pressed when the hero is crouching, the Turrican will morph into a shuriken shape. In this state, it will roll to the left or the right, damaging enemies while being invincible and small bombs can be dropped by pressing the fire button;
Finally, the most powerful attack, which can only be used one time per life, can be delivered by pressing the fire button and the space bar at the same time. The Turrican suit will morph into a shuriken shape and fly around the screen for several seconds, while firing shots of the different weapons in multiple directions.

        <desc>Finding the mysterious Elephant's Graveyard in Africa was your Father's lifelong quest. When he disappears you are determined to find out what might have happened to him, and what secrets may lie within.

This side scrolling arcade adventure is split into three stages, taking in the harsh and barren desert, an underground network of caves, and a tough tribal jungle. The natives are hostile to your presence, and weaponry must be found to fend them off, although its use does little to put the natives at ease initially. The machete to cut through the jungle is equally important. At many other points you will need to use objects you have found along the way. The backgrounds are in full 3D and can serve to obscure the character when he is behind trees or rocks.

        <desc>Side-scrolling shoot-em-up, in a similar style to such games as Gradius, R-Type and Scramble. The aim is to wipe out the enemy, which has gathered around the allied airspace of 'Area 88', in a series of military aircraft-based scenarios.
 You choose one of three unique pilots; Shin Kazama, Micky Schymon or Greg Gates, each with varying abilities at damage repair, weapon handling and flying skill, and engage the enemy over a series of challenging missions. The player starts out with the weakest plane, the F8E Crusader, which can only be armed with a very basic range weapons. But, through completing various missions, enough cash can be raised to purchase higher-quality aircraft. These superior planes are more agile, have improved resilience to damage and have a greater range of fire. Furthermore, the more advanced fighters can be armed with superior special weapons, such as napalm.
 The missions include attacks on sand bases, the nuclear submarine 'Seavet' and enemy supply camps, as well as seeing off groups of airborne 'bandits' who swarm-in on Area 88.
 The enemy is plentiful, and the pace is frantic. Shoot at everything on the screen that moves, and the allied forces might just come out on top......

        <desc>Sabreman’s second game (following Sabre Wulf and preceding Knight Lore and Pentagram) finds him trapped in an underground cavern network, split into nearly 600 side-viewed screens. There are three ways to escape, each protected by a guardian who can be killed using one of the three major weapons you can locate – a dagger, a torch and a knife.

As you explore the levels, you will encounter randomly-moving nasties, who can’t kill you but can knock you off your path and cause you to fall. Eagles can grab and drop you in mid-air. Falls of much more than a screen’s height cost you a life, although extra ones are available. Jewels can be collected for temporary invincibility.

The game’s screens are functionally split into Castle and Caverns, with the castle screens higher up. Moving across the castles involves a lot of blind jumps, often deliberately bouncing off fortuitously-placed objects such as flower pots. In the caverns, use a rope to hook onto the ceilings and move up and down – if you have found it. How many screens deep you are is noted on screen at all times.

Now he wants to experience the adventures of his good old idols while he keeps engrossing his bank account, ?cause that's the very matter of his existence.

After gathering precious prizes following the steps of his favourite classic videogame heroes (this is, the fire which doesn't burn -which looks great in the hall of his house-, the proton pistol with the proton charger, three knickers from Gremla, the book of bills of Miner Willy, Wally's pajamas, the Sword of Power (just a copy, ?cause the real one is in use), heaps of Saimaza coffee?), he learns that a mysterious and excentric millionaire, formerly a thief, hides quite a big fortune in gold coins in a very old manor next to Canutos Forest -the so-called Storm Palace. So he decides to emulate his idol Goodie and steal them!

The problem is that it won't be very easy? The cellar of Storm Palace are quite deep and are full of nooks and crannies. Besides, the intrincate disposition of rooms makes it very easy to get lost and go back to the starting point. That's what happened to Uwol: his greed made him to get deeper and deeper into the manor so he got lost and trapped in the lowest labyrinth, inhabited by Vampy, Franky, Fanty and Wolfy, who will try by all means to make Uwol fail in his task.</desc>

The plot involved an alien invasion of Earth by a reptilian race known as "The Visitors". In this game, you play as Mike Donovan, a resistance leader who enters the visitors' huge spaceship in order to blow up its reactor by setting explosives at key points.

The aliens will try to stop you as will surveillance, cleaner, maintenance, and security robots. If you touch any robots or are shot by them, a static charge will cause your heartbeat to increase. If this happens several times you have to rest or it could kill you. In 8 different laboratories you will find formulas for Red Dust which is lethal to the aliens - releasing it into air purification plants will kill many of them and also slow the robots. You can use a laser or when its charge runs out, you can jump over or roll under enemies.</desc>

In the first part you have to solve a puzzle by putting the parts in the correct order.

In the second part you control three characters at the same time. Each character carries its own objects and attributes, while they enter the volcano on their way to the center of the earth. They have to pass water cascades, geysers and eventually a lake with a monster.

In the third part you have to choose one of the three ways to get to the surface of the earth.
Each route is different and has its own dangers like tigers, carnivorous plants and quick sand.

There are 3 sub-levels on each station, which can be played in any order. The action scrolls in every direction, with you guiding your tank-link droid around to shoot the opposition droids. The tank takes a while to steer, making it initially harder to avoid contact with those enemies. Each level contains energy stars, which can be traded in for upgrades such as improved weapons and extra speed after each level.

Viewed in remote 3D with a patchwork-quilt type ground effect, with trees sticking out and full gravity. Controlling your spaceship involves balancing the direction and height as well as thrusting to the right speed. A scanner tells you where the aliens are.

        <name>Wacky Darts (128K)</name>
        <desc>The bar-room game of darts involves aiming small projectiles at a circular board. The board is divided into 20 shapes around the edge, each of which has a value from 1 to 20 points, a special 'double' area around the edge, and a special 'treble' area in the middle (each of which multiply the shot score). There is also a Bullseye right in the middle for 50 points, and an Outer Bull around it, worth 25 points. 

Players always take three shots at a time. In the 501 game the aim is to reduce your score from 501 to 0, finishing with a double or the bull. If your score reaches 1 or a negative number, any shots in that set of 3 are cancelled out. In Round The Board you must hit each target in turn starting with 20, but moving back 2 or 3 for a double or treble, eventually finishing with Double Top.

Both of these games are recreated in this simulation. The movement of the cursor you use to aim is slightly skiddy, to recreate natural jitters (or, as some would cynically suggest, the effects of being as drunk as most darts players).

Wacky Darts lives up to its name by featuring an assortment of human, alien and machine opponents of varying difficulties. Each of them has a short profile, and use a different object to hit the board.

All manner of objects can be collected, sometimes by taking a more precarious route through a screen, adding a real puzzle element to the game.

Gameplay mainly involves propelling your jumpsuit-backed and powerfully-armed character through the levels, destroying the alien forces as he goes. The levels have lots of pieces of ledges and spikes all around, which must be planned around, as well as lava pits. There is extra weaponry and ammunition to collect along the way. Your main weapon can be fired in any direction, but you can't move and fire at the same time unless you're firing to the left or right.

        <name>Way of the Exploding Fist, The (48K)</name>
        <desc>This menacingly-titled beat 'em up was the first in many martial arts titles from Australia's Melbourne House. Sixteen different moves are on offer, ranging from standard kicks to jumps, somersaults and roundhouse kicks.

The move executed each time is defined based on the character's direction, the joystick/keyboard positioning, and on whether the fire button is depressed, in a system which became standard on single-button control systems.

To win each bout you must score 2 Yin-Yangs - a perfectly executed kick/punch scores a full one, whereas a less forceful contact offers half a point - the best moves also offer more points. In the one-player game, you advance through a Dan by winning two successive bouts, and a single win for the opponent means game over. The champion in a two-player duel is decided by points after 4 rounds.

Although you're racing against the other cars, you must make each checkpoint in the required amount of time in order to complete the game. The lap is split into three sections, so the fourth section is identical to the first, the fifth to the second, and so on. 

As the game goes on, the bonus time offered for each section drops, so you have to drive better as the game goes on to stay in. Night is represented as well, with everything darkened and the need for headlights. The circuit features barriers and trackside trees, so avoid contact with these, and try not to stray onto the grass as this slows you down.

        <name>Where Time Stood Still (128K)</name>
        <desc>While flying three members of the same family, your planes crash-lands in an area where it soon becomes clear that time has stood still - dinosaurs still roam the area, and the humans are primitive and carnivorous. Your task is to guide them to safety through the complex isometrically viewed world (using the same basic game engine as Denton Designs' Great Escape license).

Hazards to be faced include the aforementioned dinosaurs and cavemen, as well as sea monsters, precarious mountainous ledges and dilapidated bridges. Objects including weapons and first aid kits can be collected. Each character has his own distinct behaviors - one becomes hungry easily, while another is only really competent while his fiancé survives. Although the ultimate aim is to save all four characters, you can continue while at least one is alive.

        <desc>Eight invaded townships must be brought back under your control in this Commando-style shoot 'em up, which progresses vertically using a flick-screen system. You are armed with a rifle (activated by a short tap of the fire button) and five grenades (used via a longer press), and must not only kill off the enemy forces, but also rescue your comrades who have been tied to trees along the way. You begin at the bottom of the first screen and slowly make your way upwards; enemies pop up from all sides, walking around and shooting, and you have to dodge their shots while trying to shoot them yourself. The foes make good use of the decoy opportunities of the terrain, and you must do the same to have a chance. The levels include rivers with narrow bridges, potholes, and train-lines.

Extra supplies are dropped in as you progress through the game, as are extra lives in addition to your starting 5.

But everything goes awry when an enigmatic fellow known only as "El Bandeeto" destroys your script and litters your equipment all over your studio. Your goal is to retrieve these things and then to safely arrive at the shooting location. 

Wild West Seymour is an action/adventure game similar to the famous Dizzy series. It consists of 4 levels (film studio, town, desert and prairie) where you have to use both your wits and your reflex to get the necessary items and use them to solve puzzles. You can hold up to 3 items at once, which forces you to do some skillful inventory management. Beware of dangers, such as deep water, which can damage you - you have a limited number of lives!

The only way to reach the fortress is by collecting ten magic eyes scattered across four levels, and defeating the demonic guardians who will try to impede Willy's progress.

Wizard Willy is an action game with platform elements. Willy can fire lightning bolts at the many enemies who intervene. The enemies are dangerous to touch, but don't fire back until later levels. Four icons are available to collect. One kills all monsters in the area, another gives an extra life, the third restores Willy to full strength at his current life, and the last restocks his lightning bolts. The levels incorporate forests (which include climbable trees), dungeons, stairways and fortresses.</desc>

        <name>Wizball (128K)</name>
        <desc>In Wizball the player takes the role of the friendly wizard Wiz who can turn himself into a green ball that is able to defend his world against the color-sucking enemies who have turned his once brightly colored Wizworld into a drab planet. With his trusty feline companion Catelite, the wizard will restore the colors to the world by retrieving them from defeated enemies.

The player starts out as a bouncing green ball that can shoot and be put into more or less heavy rotation to move slowly or faster, physically correct through the side-scrolling levels. The first task is to upgrade the ball by shooting the first non-moving enemies, and collect the green bubbles that are left by them. In order to stand a chance against the following moving enemy waves, some upgrades are a must. First and foremost, complete control over the ball should be activated (i.e. flying through the levels), a shield sheltering the top and bottom of the player's should be acquired, and two-way fire (left/right) should be obtained.

But the extra needed to advance in Wizball is your friend Catelite who will, once summoned, take the form of a small green satellite that will imitate the ball's movement, or can be directly controlled by the player. Besides upping Wiz' fire power, Catelite is able to collect paint drops left by a certain kind of defeated enemies until the respective color pot is filled up. There's three colors available (red, green and blue), and several different combinations of them must be collected to complete a level and restore it to former colorfulness. Every color combination collected will send Wiz to a bonus stage, then to his laboratory where one of the power-ups can be made permanently.

The game also features a bunch of multi-player modes, there's even a two-player cooperative mode amongst them.

        <desc>Just when things were going great with Tom-Tom and his girlfriend Tanya, some thug of a woodland king had to kidnap her and hide her away, and Tom-Tom doesn't have a clue where. That's why he has to explore deep dark forests, cross endless oceans, climb treacherous slopes, survive endless volcanoes, and even walk through clouds. But Tom-Tom will never be totally alone. You see, when he goes through the exotic locations, he has to come face to face with its inhabitants, like bees, spiders, snakes, coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, coyotes, and octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet is Tom-Tom's only line of defense against these menaces.

There are ten areas, each containing four rounds each, but the tenth area can't be accessed unless Tom-Tom collects all the dolls during his rescue mission. During his journey, he can break open different eggs that will reveal hatchets, skateboards, mushrooms, milk, and even guardian angels. You can ride the skateboard through each round, as long as you don't collide with an inhabitant. When you complete each round while still riding the skateboard, you'll start the next round still riding it. As you progress through each round, your vitality will start to get low, but it can be increased by getting milk, mushrooms, potato chips,or fruit that appear everywhere you go. As well as the normal eggs, there are also speckled eggs that must be avoided, otherwise the God of Death will be released, and once he follows you, you'll lose vitality much quickly. At the end of every fourth round, there is a king waiting to destroy you with his fireballs or lightning bolts.

There are also warp-gates, but you don't find them, they find you. You see, warp-gates appear in rounds 1-4 of each area. If you happen to get one fruit, a special item will appear. These special items include handbags, wrist watches, a pair of shoes, a teddy bear, and a bottle of perfume. Another girl will appear and take you up to the clouds where the object is to collect as many hearts as you can without falling down or getting the item again. Once you have collected all the hearts, you can get the item to return to the surface, and more often than not, you'll get further in the round.

        <name>WWF WrestleMania (128K)</name>
        <desc>At the height of the World Wrestling Federation's European fame came this crunching recreation of the elaborate hammed-up action. Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior or the British Bulldog can come under your control.

You play either in practice matches (against the hopefully-misnamed Mr Perfect) or in a sequence of 5 matches to win the Wrestlemania Belt. Your opponents have different special moves - watch out for The Warlord's Full Nelson and Sgt. Slaughter's Camel Clutch, for example. Before the fights start, your opponents will deliver a taunt, which you must respond to as creatively as possible.

The game is a beat 'em up viewed from a forced perspective above and behind the action. Your aim is to pin your opponent to the ground for 3 seconds, which can only be done once he has been weakened. Kicks, punches and throws will reduce an opponent's strength bar. When a strong opponent is down, stamping on him will pay off more than attempting a pin.

Avoid leaving the ring for too long - 20 seconds out and the match is void, which counts as a defeat. As in real WWF, the frame of the arena can be used to perform moves. Once players are in close contact, waggle the joystick to ensure you win the grapple.

        <desc>Xeno is a future sport resembling Air Hockey. Each of the two players (the second being either human or computer controlled) controls a ground skimmer, which is aiming to hit a puck so as to knock it into their opponent's goal. This is done in a turn-based manner, in which each player controls a movement line which sets up their intended move before it is enacted. 

The arena is surrounded by walls, so rebounds (of both the puck and the skimmers) have to be factored into your shot selection. You are not required to hit the puck with a shot, so some shots can be defensive-minded. You can toggle between 1 and 9 seconds for the shot time, and between 1 and 9 minutes for the length of each of the four quarters.

        <name>Xenon (128K)</name>
        <desc>Xenon is the obscure and mysterious predecessor to the much better known Xenon 2: Megablast. The game is actually nothing like its sequel, with completely different control scheme and gameplay. The plot overlaps however, with the Xenites making their first attempt to control the galaxy.

Xenon is essentially an overhead shooter, where the player controls the ship and moves around the screen. However, the difference between Xenon and its sequel is that here the player actually controls the movement of the playfield (up or down) by simply moving the ship in the direction of choice. To do this in the sequel, players need to slam your ship against the bottom of the screen and pull back on the stick in order to reverse-scroll the playfield.

It also features a 3D playfield (some enemies, for example, will be mounted on hills of sort, where players can't shoot them). To combat these the player can transform its tank into a plane. The game then switches to the more familiar gameplay style as seen in other vertically scrolling shooters. The plane has to transform back into a tank again to combat most ground units.

In Xenon, upgrades are taken from destroyed enemies.

        <desc>Xenos.  The very name strikes fear into every colonist's heart.  A distress call is received from space stations orbiting your homeworld, then silence.  A single ship escapes, piloted by a battered man who tells the tale of pods that hatch into acid-spitting Xenos.

A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld.  Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it.  You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs.

Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987.  Gameplay premise and setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the movie Aliens.

        <desc>It is discovered that the actual aliens on earth are human beings, and the ruthless Xevions want their planet back; but without us. Our only defense is the prototype Solvalou Fighter Plane. With this plane we can fight the deadly Domogram Rovers; the Toroid Patrol Fleets and the Zoshi Death Squads. 

Xevious is a vertically scrolling shooter based on the 1982 coin-op of the same name. It was innovative in that it was the first vertically scrolling shooter to feature dual-level attacks; both ground and air.

        <name>Yabba Dabba Doo! - Flintstones (48K)</name>
        <desc>The Flintstones is a game based on the popular cartoon series The Flintstones by Hanna-Barbera Productions Inc.

It's weekend! Fred Flintstone thinks of only one thing: bowling  
with his friend and neighbor Barney.
Unfortunately, his wife Wilma got other plans for him. Fred has to paint the living room and Wilma is not going to help him with it. No, she goes shopping.
And if that's not enough, Wilma also tells Fred that his mother-in-law is coming over.

The Flintstones game is divided in four parts.

Part 1: Painting the walls of your living room.
To go to the bowling alley before it is closed Fred has to paint  the walls as quickly as possible. To paint the walls Fred uses the tail of a living squirrel. 
Pebbles tries to leap out her playpen and starts crawling around and starts scribbling on the walls. If Fred wants to put Pebbles back in the playpen then he has to drop the squirrel, that immediately starts wandering off. When Pebbles is back in the playpen Fred has to chase the squirrel and dip its tail in the paint again.

Part 2: Driving your car on the way to the bowling center.
Finally, when all walls are painted Fred can go to the bowling  
alley!
Fred has to drive to the bowling alley but unfortunately the roads are in a very bad condition. The road surface is dire and covered with rocks!
And if one of the wheels hit a bump it will break off the car and disappear into the distance.

Part 3: A bowling competition between Fred and Barney.
At the bowling alley the following bowling parameters can be set: the spin and speed of the ball and the starting position of the player.
Each turn gives two throws (except he gets a strike). A game  
takes ten turns. while a match takes three games.

Part 4: Saving Pebbles at a construction site.
On his way home Fred discovers that Pebbles has disappeared!  Don't let Wilma find that out!
Fred finds Pebbles at a construction site on top of some  
scaffolding. He has to climb the scaffolding to rescue her.
If Fred fails to rescue his daughter then Barney rescues her and Fred will be branded as a failure!

        <desc>This adventure consists in crossing the mysterious world of Yenght, trying to find the Source of Youth, indispensable condition to manage to culminate the adventure successfully. The game begins with a complicated labyrinth, in which is necessary to find: first, a key, and later, the exit. In order to do it, it's necessary to make a map of the labyrinth since with no additional help, it would be really difficult to find the exit without being destroyed by some of the enemies who live there. Once outside, the real adventure begins. But it's advisable to make another map, otherwise it's possible to arrive at places where it's very difficult to exit from, and well, it's even possible to return to the labyrinth since there are remote parts which communicate with it.

Yogi must travel across Yellowstone Park to rescue his friend Boo-Boo, who has been kidnapped. Travel through 198 screens to reach him, collecting six toffee apples en route - these are converted into a code which allows Boo-Boo to be rescued without his kidnapper raising a fuss.

The park scrolls sideways, with Yogi moving into and out of the layered screens. It contains animals who can harm you on contact, as well as black holes and water hazards. Contact with the park ranger or tourists is also forbidden. Yogi must watch his energy level, which is kept up by swiping fish and pick-a-nick baskets. Boo-Boo must be rescued before he and Yogi have to hibernate for the winter.

        <desc>The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in this isometric-viewed shoot 'em up which was originally hugely successful in the arcades. The game has 3 stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.

Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, with the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are 3 distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.

        <desc>A directly TRON-inspired (though unlicensed) variety of the snake game, Zona 0 puts the player in control of a "light cycle" that zooms across an enclosed grid with other bikes, each leaving impassable lines in their wake.  As the play field gets cluttered up with these trails, it gets more and more difficult to avoid accidentally driving in to one, veering sharply with 90-degree turns.  The player's goal is to outlast the computer-operated light bikes, proceeding to the next level.

        <desc>All the ingredients from the Zorro story feature in this action game - a kidnapped senorita, an evil enemy leader (Colonel Garcia) and his henchmen and of course the obligatory swordfight!

This computer version of Zorro is a strange beast, he can leap across buildings, fall 50 feet and land like a feather, with neither a scratch to his head or a crease in his cape. He can also perform masterful tricks, such as balancing a large plant pot on his head, while simultaneously climbing up a ladder.

Zorro has similar platform gameplay to the same company's Bruce Lee game, but with a slower pace and more puzzle elements. There are 20 different screens in the game, with The Ole Hotel screen being used continually throughout the game. The player must overcome various puzzles, including the branding of a bull and catapulting into the air via a conveniently left spring board and a dazed Garcia guard!

        <desc>Zub is a cartoon platform game, the first title developed by the brothers Ste Pickford and John Pickford as a team. In a humorous twist, every creature in the game is named Zub, including the main character. The player controls Zub, an alien warrior that received a mission from his Emperor Zub of the Zub galactic empire: to retrieve the Green Eye of Zub, a powerful artifact.

Zub must ride the intergalactic elevators to reach other planets and continue the search for the Eye. The worlds are very empty, featuring a few platforms and sparsely populated by dangerous monsters called Zubs. Zub must hop to the existing platforms, position them next to each other, and keep jumping and alternating between them to ascend to the top of the level and move to the next planet. The Zubs float around the scene following the hero, trying to touch and drain some of the health energy, and have to be killed with the laser gun.

        <desc>Zybex is a horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up inspired by Side Arms and Nemesis/Gradius. The players took control of prisoners trying to win freedom from a galactic prison. At the end of each level they earned a crystal, opening access to the later levels of the game.

There are 16 levels in total, with numbers 2-12 immediately available after completing the first - the player can go through them in any order. However, levels 13-16 are locked until the player earns enough crystals.

The weapon system is quite unique - the player constantly fires, and the fire button is simply used to change the current weapon. The basic weapon is the Orbiter, which the player always has. Picking up weapon icons increases the power of a weapon by 1 up to the maximum of power level 4. Dying reduces the current weapon by 1 power level, or loses it if the weapon is power 1 (with the exception of the Orbiter). As the weapons get more power, their fire rate becomes faster and the bullets stronger. The five weapons are Orbiter, 8-way (upgrades from 2 to 4 to 6 to 8 way fire), Railgun (powerful single bullet which gets longer) Pulse (fires straight forward and gains diagonal fire at power 3/4) and Wall (another forward fire, which gains size).

        <desc>This horizontally-scrolling shoot 'em up features 16 levels and 450 screens of Nemesis-inspired action. You pilot a spacecraft through the levels, shooting as many of the encroaching meanies and mounted turrets as possible. Power-up tokens are offered for shooting some, which can be used to obtain better weapons including ground-attack lasers, speed ups and multiple bullets. Extra lives are on offer as well, which you'll certainly need, especially as you have to go back a long way when losing a life.
