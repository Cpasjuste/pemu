        <name>Crush Roller (World)</name>
        <desc>Crush Roller is a game for the Neo Geo Pocket Color based on the 1981 arcade game Make Trax, which was released as Crush Roller in Europe and Asia.

The object of the game is to color the entire maze-like playing field with a paint brush. While you paint, two enemies walk around in the maze, when they hit you, you lose a life.

A level has rollers which you can push forward with your paint brush. If you capture an enemy in the path of the roller he dies and is temporarily taken out of the game. This scores you extra points. Each subsequent enemy rolled over is worth more points.

Every once in a while another creature will pop up, it will run around leaving behind track marks in your paint. Painting over this creature removes it from the game and scores you additional points. His tracks have to be repainted.

When the entire maze is painted you win the level. Unlike the original arcade version the Neo Geo Pocket Color version has multiple levels.</desc>

Much like its predecessor, the game is a unique blend of traditional RPG and strategy gameplay. As the hero of the game, you lead a growing army of troops as you progress through the game in a series of pivotal battles. Before each battle you are given the option to setup your army into distinct groups. Then you are given a mission on the map and you can then set your army out to do your bidding. As your unit groups travel along the map on the way to their given objective, they'll happen along enemy unit groups. When they meet, the game switches to an isometric-view of the automated turn-based battle that ensues.</desc>

The gameplay is more arcade than simulation. The focus is on stopping at the stations at the perfect moment and position, keeping up with the schedule, obeying signals and speed limits, and ensuring the safety and comfort of the passengers. Mistakes result in points being deducted from a counter. If it reaches 0, the game is over.

The following routes are available:

1. Hokuhoku Line from Naoetsu to Uragawara
2. Tohoku Shinkansen from Morioka to Shin-Hanamaki
3. Akita Shinkansen from Akita to Omagari
4. Keihin-Tohoku Line from Shinagawa to Ueno
5. Osaka Loop Line from Osaka to Tennoji (not in the Arcade original)
6. Kagoshima Main Line from Hakata to Kokura (only in PlayStation and Windows versions)</desc>

        <name>Densha de Go! 2 on Neo Geo Pocket (Jpn, Prototype)</name>
        <desc>The 1998 sequel of the popular Japanese train driving game by Taito has once again been ported to various home systems. For the first time on the PlayStation, it is possible to drive through the snow, and take a seat in the cockpit of a Shinkansen bullet train.

The gameplay is more arcade than simulation. The focus is on stopping at the stations at the perfect moment and position, keeping up with the schedule, obeying signals and speed limits, and ensuring the safety and comfort of the passengers. Mistakes result in points being deducted from a counter. If it reaches 0, the game is over.

The following routes are available:

1. Hokuhoku Line from Naoetsu to Uragawara
2. Tohoku Shinkansen from Morioka to Shin-Hanamaki
3. Akita Shinkansen from Akita to Omagari
4. Keihin-Tohoku Line from Shinagawa to Ueno
5. Osaka Loop Line from Osaka to Tennoji (not in the Arcade original)
6. Kagoshima Main Line from Hakata to Kokura (only in PlayStation and Windows versions)</desc>

        <desc>The player takes control of a character named Matt. The game is set in the future and the world is primarily surrounded by water. The only small patch of land called is called Terra. The player must show their worth to be accepted on to Terra by proving their skill as a submarine commander and destroying enemy vessels.

Matt's version features different characters, items and boats to Becky's version. These are logged in a device similar to a Pokédex. The battles take place against other ships. A radar view is used to help players guide torpedoes against the enemy. A large part of the game is text based with animated cutscenes. Two players can link-up with the cable to battle, exchange ships and accumulate other data.</desc>

        <desc>Dive Alert: Becky's Version is an RPG for the Neo Geo Pocket Color. There is another version of Dive Alert called Dive Alert: Matt's Version. The two games are rather like joint Pokemon releases (Red/Blue, etc) wherein they are overall the same game with a variety of smaller differences.

The player takes control of a character named Becky. The game takes place in the future and the world is primarily surrounded by water. The only land is a small patch called Terra. The player must prove their worth to be accepted on to Terra by proving their skill as a submarine commander and destroying enemy vessels.

Becky's version features different characters, items and boats from Matt's Version. These are logged in a device similar to a Pokédex (from Pokemon). Battles take place against enemy ships and a radar view is used to help the player guide torpedoes towards the enemy vessels. Much of the game is text-based with animated cutscenes. 

The game features the ability for two players to link up Neo Geo Pocket Color units to exchanges ships and data, and to battle one on one.  The game also features battery back-up and a training mode.</desc>

        <name>Evolution - Eternal Dungeons (Euro)</name>
        <desc>A portable version of Evolution: The World of Sacred Device. Eternal Dungeon tells the story of the young explorer Mag Launcher and his quest for the fabled Evolutia, an item of immense power.

The basic premise of the game is to take quests in the town and then assemble your party and attempt to clear out the many dungeons in the game, grinding your characters and getting the loot and experience needed to advance the plot and buy items, equipment, and upgrades for your Cy-frame, a robotic attachment that enables Mag to enhance his combat abilities.

As expected for a portable version, the gameplay has been significantly downgraded from its original Dreamcast version. Town navigation is menu-driven and all graphics are now top-down 2D sprites, with all dungeons being pre-designed instead of randomly generated. Combat is turn-based using a menu system from which you select your actions for each party member (up to 3) and execute them, but otherwise remains unchanged.</desc>

Gameplay revolves around the battles and customising your TS between those battles.

Battles are part turn based and part realtime. The player inputs their actions at the beginning of the turn. The amount of actions they can input is dependant on their type of TS. Once they have finished their selection everything is played out in realtime for the duration of the turn. This makes thinking about what your opponents and allies will do in advance essential before taking your turn.</desc>

        <desc>In this unique game you keep watch on the wacky Neo Poke-kun, a cartoony programmer...thing that lives locked in his small Tokyo apartment. You don't have direct control of his actions but instead interact with him indirectly by switching stuff in his apartment on and off, which triggers different reactions from him. More importantly you can invite different characters to visit Neo Poke-kun, which will also trigger different reactions from him. Depending on the time of day and the visitor you may get different reactions from Poke-kun, and if you make him happy enough he'll get to work and code a mini-game for you.

These collection of 30 games form the bulk of the gameplay, and include different clones of other games, shooters, short platformers, and compact puzzle challenges similar to Wario Ware

The game has a distinctly bizarre sense of humor with tons of wacky animations played whenever something happens to your Poke-kun, and while some games use basic vector graphics, most use 2D sprites.</desc>

The game features Story, Self Challenge and Friend Challenge; these correspond to the standard 1P VS Com, Solo, and 2P VS modes featured in other Magical Drop games. Story features five difficulty modes while Self Challenge features three.

Like many other handheld puzzle games of the time, Story does not feature a "true" AI opponent; instead, the player attempts to fill a gauge by creating chains. While the player attempts to fill this gauge, the AI attacks at random intervals.</desc>

        <name>Oekaki Puzzle (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>Picture Puzzle (Oekaki Puzzle in Japan) is a paint-by-numbers puzzle game developed by Success for the Neo Geo Pocket Color. The game plays identical to Nintendo's Picross series. Picture Puzzle offers a total of 200 puzzles: 20 5x5 puzzles, 105 10x10's, and 75 15x15's. This is biased towards smaller puzzles because the grids in anything larger would be incredibly tiny on the NGPC's screen. Also, larger puzzles take much longer to solve; smaller puzzles allows you to pick up the Pocket for 10-20 minutes at a time and, on a good day, solve a complete puzzle.

Upon completion of a puzzle, the game replaces it with a colored version of the same grid and gives it a title. Especially with the smaller puzzles, this is helpful in that it is sometimes otherwise unclear as to what exactly the completed picture is supposed to be. Because it colorizes them, the game requires the Neo Geo Pocket Color, i.e, it won't run on a monochrome Neo Geo Pocket.</desc>

        <desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

        <name>Picture Puzzle (Euro, USA)</name>
        <desc>Picture Puzzle (Oekaki Puzzle in Japan) is a paint-by-numbers puzzle game developed by Success for the Neo Geo Pocket Color. The game plays identical to Nintendo's Picross series. Picture Puzzle offers a total of 200 puzzles: 20 5x5 puzzles, 105 10x10's, and 75 15x15's. This is biased towards smaller puzzles because the grids in anything larger would be incredibly tiny on the NGPC's screen. Also, larger puzzles take much longer to solve; smaller puzzles allows you to pick up the Pocket for 10-20 minutes at a time and, on a good day, solve a complete puzzle.

Upon completion of a puzzle, the game replaces it with a colored version of the same grid and gives it a title. Especially with the smaller puzzles, this is helpful in that it is sometimes otherwise unclear as to what exactly the completed picture is supposed to be. Because it colorizes them, the game requires the Neo Geo Pocket Color, i.e, it won't run on a monochrome Neo Geo Pocket.</desc>

        <name>Pocket Casino Series - Neo 21 (Euro, USA)</name>
        <desc>Neo 21 is a casino-style blackjack game that offers three modes of play: Casino Mode, Original Mode, and Versus mode. As a casino style game, it supports all the actions that players sitting at a casino blackjack table can perform.

Blackjack, also known as "twenty-one," is a card game where players attempt to put together a hand that adds up to as close to 21 in total points without going over. Aces count for one or eleven, face cards count for ten, and the other cards count as their respective values.

At the beginning of each hand, the dealer deals each player, including the dealer, two cards. Each round players can opt to hit, stand, split or double down. When a player calls for a hit, the dealer deals another card. A player who stands is dealt no more cards for the rest of the hand. Players who get dealt two cards of the same value can split them, put another wager down and play both as individual hands. Doubling down is the act of calling for one last hit, and doubling your wager at the same time. Any player who goes over 21 in value busts and loses.

In Neo 21, players engage in a one-on-one match against a CPU dealer, or in the Versus Mode, two players can compete via the link cable, with one acting as the dealer.</desc>

        <name>Pocket Fighting Series - Garou Densetsu First Contact ~ Fatal Fury F-Contact (World)</name>
        <desc>Using the world-famous Japanese "SD" (Super-Deformed) artwork style, this is the only title of the Fatal Fury series to be released on SNK's color handheld.

The game is based on its arcade/console counterpart Real Bout Fatal Fury 2: The Newcomers, and has its main characteristics, like the possibility of execute special moves while blocking (a.k.a. Breakshots), the execution of high-strength blows (a.k.a. S. Power and P. Power moves) and the starring of two new combatants (Li Xiangfei and Rick Strowd).

Due to NGPC hardware limitations, some characters have been removed from the main cast (as well as the background/foreground battle plane system). With this, the fighters initially available for this contest are: Andy Bogard, Terry Bogard, Joe Higashi, Mai Shiranui, Kim Kaphwan, Ryuji Yamazaki, Rick Strowd, Li Xiangfei, Billy Kane, Wolfgang Krauser and Geese Howard.</desc>

        <desc>The King of Fighters: R1 marks SNK's first time bringing the KOF series onto a handheld... and what better system than their own Neo Geo Pocket to do just that? 14 of the most well known KOF characters make their appearance in KOF: R-1, along with some recognizable backgrounds and gameplay features based on The King of Fighters '97. Players can choose from "Extra" &amp; "Advance" play modes similar to KOF '97, and most characters play closely to their original versions.</desc>

        <desc>Using again the Japanese "SD" (Super-Deformed) artwork style (now reworked), the KOF Series makes your debut in the new SNK's color handheld. The title brings the same gameplay characteristics present in its arcade/console counter-part The King of Fighters '98, like the possibility of choose between two game modes (Advanced or Extra), an identical adaptation of the battle stages, the addition of "Advantage System" (directly related to the power gauges) and the chance to battle with a powered version of the "franchise boss", Rugal Bernstein.

Unlike the previous game (The King of Fighters R-1), this sequence doesn't have a defined storyline, but it's implicit that Rugal is still alive and returns once again to try conquer the world and satisfy his evil ambitions.

The teams included in the game were slightly reformulated and now are the following ones (this time, Leona Heidern and Iori Yagami are single entries):

1. Team Kusanagi (Kyo Kusanagi, Saisyu Kusanagi and Shingo Yabuki)Super Babe Team (Athena Asamiya, Yuri Sakazaki and Kasumi Todo)
2. New Southtown Team (Ryo Sakazaki, Mai Shiranui and Terry Bogard)

        <name>Pocket Fighting Series - Samurai Spirit! (Jpn) ~ Samurai Shodown! (Euro)</name>
        <desc>Samurai Shodown! Pocket is essentially a "portable" version of Samurai Shodown 4. Like the other fighting games on the Neo Geo Pocket, the characters are drawn in Super Deformed chibi style (big heads and tiny bodies). This title was also one of the first games for the Neo Geo Pocket, so the game was only in black and white... The gameplay of Samurai Shodown is quite well adapted in the pocket version, but it is not as enjoyable as the Neo Geo classic. The gameplay is very simplified in this version. The characters keep most of their special moves and moves, but the deep strategies of the arcade are almost gone. It's basically a new game that, while not spectacular, is fun.</desc>

What makes this a challenging two-player contest is the fact that when you clear a chain of puyos from your grid, it drops a random piece of filler onto your opponent's grid. The more puyos you clear, the more you fill your opponent's grid, and if you can clutter up his grid enough to fill it to the top, you've won the game.</desc>

The game is over when the first blocks reach the bottom of the screen. You can dissolve blocks by shooting at them. The shots form a line where they impact. If that line connects otherwise unconnected blocks of the same color they will dissolve.

There are three different modes: In "Normal" you have to link two special blocks that appear after some time. If you manage to finish the level within the time limit you will unlock one of 50 collectible cards. In "Clear Mode" you have to clear a given constellation of blocks. "Battle Mode" is a two player link-cable mode.</desc>

New blocks constantly scroll into the screen from the top. The game is over when the first blocks reach the bottom of the screen. You can dissolve blocks by shooting at them. The shots form a line where they impact. If that line connects otherwise unconnected blocks of the same color they will dissolve.

There are new modes in Puzzle Link 2. Like the original, there are the standard challenge and puzzle rounds. But new to the series is the marathon-style game where you continue eliminating pieces as the game gradually increases speed. In this mode, more power-ups appear as the player performs faster. Here, you get three shots that will eliminate the same color tile from the board. The game also has link cable support for two players.</desc>

The battles are fought linearly in any order, and after each boss is defeated, a special weapon is added to the player's arsenal. 
Each boss is weak to one specific weapon, so the player is encouraged to strategize the order in which the bosses are faced. 
Two players can use a link cable to transfer database information between systems, but no co-op or versus play is supported.</desc>

        <desc>A portable version of Evolution: The World of Sacred Device. Eternal Dungeon tells the story of the young explorer Mag Launcher and his quest for the fabled Evolutia, an item of immense power.

The basic premise of the game is to take quests in the town and then assemble your party and attempt to clear out the many dungeons in the game, grinding your characters and getting the loot and experience needed to advance the plot and buy items, equipment, and upgrades for your Cy-frame, a robotic attachment that enables Mag to enhance his combat abilities.

As expected for a portable version, the gameplay has been significantly downgraded from its original Dreamcast version. Town navigation is menu-driven and all graphics are now top-down 2D sprites, with all dungeons being pre-designed instead of randomly generated. Combat is turn-based using a menu system from which you select your actions for each party member (up to 3) and execute them, but otherwise remains unchanged.</desc>

        <desc>Organized and sponsored by a mysterious fighter nicknamed as "Miss X", the first Queen of Fighters Tournament is officially open, but this competition differs of the others for allowing ONLY women as participants. Meanwhile, after have passed for several and tough fights (including a final showdown with Miss X), the winner will be rewarded with a mystical artifact known as the "K Talisman", that has the capacity to grant any wish. With this rare-unique possibility of accomplish their pessoal dreams and ambitions, 8 powerful femme fatale fighters were invited to face the biggest combat of their lives...

Behind this simple storyline, the title brings a cast of 8 all-female characters taken from SNK's fighting series The King of Fighters (Mai Shiranui, Yuri Sakazaki, Athena Asamiya, Leona Heidern, Shermie), The Last Blade (Akari Ichijyou) and Samurai Shodown (Shiki, Nakoruru); all with the same blows (parodied or not) of their origin games.

The gameplay is identical to KOF's Advanced Mode (e.g. Emergency Evasion and Run commands), but without SDMs. To increase the replay factor, a power-up mode was included: depending on your combat performance, you'll be favored with several random items (e.g. Start with full MAX gauge, Speed Up etc.) that can be used to improve your character for a while.</desc>

        <desc>Super Real Mahjong Premium Collection is the first portable installment of the Super Real Mahjong series. As usual, you play strip mahjong with pretty girls, this time several from many of the games. However, due to system limitations, only some strip scenes are animated. It also has some visual novel-like qualities, in particular a story mode where you try to focus on one girl each time the game is played. This is accomplished by choosing the right options when presented to you. If you manage to focus on a single girl, her CG is unlocked in the gallery.</desc>

        <name>The King of Fighters - Battle de Paradise (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>The King of Fighters: Battle De Paradise is a board based, two player party game that plays in a similar manner as sugoroku. The player can either link with another user to play or challenge the CPU. Each side choose one of four original characters to represent their place on the board as well as an accompanying Striker character (the Extra Strikers from The King of Fighters '99: Evolution). If they're unsatisfied with their avatar's name, an option to rename their character is also given.

Players roll a dice and move along the board with various squares. Specially marked squares can trigger one of many mini-games for the player's striker to participate in for coins. Mini-games themselves are a collection of memory games, dodging contests, quiz challenges, and other games common to the genre. Some of these mini-games refer to SNK's older games such as T.A.N.K or previous King of Fighters titles. The main goal of the game is to gather coins to buy stars; the player with the most stars wins.</desc>

        <desc>The gameplay of Puzzle Link 2 is generally identical to the first game: Puzzle Link is a game where blocks of matching color have to be dissolved. New blocks constantly scroll into the screen from the top. The game is over when the first blocks reach the bottom of the screen. You can dissolve blocks by shooting at them. The shots form a line where they impact. If that line connects otherwise unconnected blocks of the same color they will dissolve.

There are new modes in Puzzle Link 2. Like the original, there are the standard challenge and puzzle rounds. But new to the series is the marathon-style game where you continue eliminating pieces as the game gradually increases speed. In this mode, more power-ups appear as the player performs faster. Here, you get three shots that will eliminate the same color tile from the board. The game also has link cable support for two players.</desc>
