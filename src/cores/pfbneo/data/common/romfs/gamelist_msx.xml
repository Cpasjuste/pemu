        <name>10-Yard Fight (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>The main idea of this game is that players take control of a football team and have the task of trying to score a touchdown before the clock runs out.

Players start out as a high school team. Games consists of two halves. One touchdown must be scored before time runs out in each half or the game is lost. After a touchdown is scored, the half ends and the 2nd half of the game starts. If the player scores in both halves, they win the game, and then move on to the next level of difficulty. Difficulty levels after high school go from college, pro, then to super. The higher the difficulty, the less amount of time is given for a player to score a touchdown.

Since the game is concerned with scoring touchdowns, in the 1 player game the player is always on offense. Players can score points for completing passes and for gaining yards by either rushing or passing. Scoring a touchdown also adds to the players score, as does any remaining time on the clock after the touchdown is scored. Also after a touchdown, the player can add on to their score by kicking an extra point. 

Other rules on the field include getting a 1st down to add time to the clock. If the player throws an interception or go four downs without getting a 1st down, they are penalized yards.


In a 2 player game, the second player plays defense until it's their turn to play offense.</desc>

        <desc>180 allows you to play a game of darts by yourself or against either the computer or another player. Before you play there are a number of games that can be selected and they are a one player game, two player game, Round the Board or Snooker. The one player game has you trying to get from the score 501 to zero, and you must try to get to zero within 20 darts and also finish with a double or Bullseye. If you manage to finish within 20 darts then you qualify for a league against seven other players and you must try to play one of seven games of darts in the lowest number of darts thrown. If you finish top of the league you then play four rounds of the World Championship which is a knock-out format. 

Two player game has you playing another player with a starting score of 101, 301 or 501 and you can also choose how many games to play from one, three or five. Round the Board is played between one or two players and the idea is to throw a dart in every number in order starting from one in the least number of darts thrown. Snooker is a two player game where you use the dart board to play a game of snooker. There are 15 reds and the other colours that make up a game of snooker and each segment of the board represents a colour. You must throw three darts in one colour to pot that colour starting with a red, and if potted you then choose a different coloured segment.

The dart boards are seen from a 1st person perspective shown on the whole screen. To throw a dart, a line moves below the board and when a key is pressed, it stops the line and shows the position the length on the board the dart will land. Another line now appears to the left of the board and when stopped this shows the height the dart will land. </desc>

        <name>3D Knockout (Euro)</name>
        <desc>Ready to match reflexes with your Atari, mano-a-mano? Sports Illustrated lent its name to this early boxing simulation, which gives you an elevation of the ring and two boxers throwing three different punches. Matching your opponent's punch makes a block; each unblocked punch is a point. At least thirty head-shots in a round may earn you a technical knockout, but that's the only knockout available. Otherwise it's five to fifteen rounds, which at three minutes per round can give you a genuine endurance contest. Wear down a friend or just a single joystick, or allow the microprocessor to take both boxers. The footwork is simple, back-and-forth, but like in the real ring, probably the key to championship.

Score, rounds, and time are displayed large enough above the play window to let a quick glance tell you where you are, but your boxer will also grunt and drop his jaw each time he gets hit. If you see a lot of that, the bell will be a welcome sound, not to mention the thirty seconds' rest between rounds.

        <desc>F-1 Spirit: The Way To Formula-1 is a top down Formula One Racing game, developed and published by Konami, which was released for the MSX in Japan and Europe in 1987. The game engine is very similar to Konami's Road Fighter. It also features Konami's custom sound chip called Konami SCC (a five-channel chip that compliments the three-channel PSG chip of the MSX computer system, or in other words, a sound custom chip that brings five voices more to the three voices of the PSG sound chip on the system), and great MSX1 graphics to go with it. It was one of the first ROM on MSX with this sound feature. Together with its "3D" spinoff (F-1 Spirit: 3D Special), F-1 Spirit: The Way To Formula-1 was the most extended racing game Konami released for the MSX.</desc>

Items may be hand grenades, stronger guns or wing items which make her jump longer. For some reason, the planet is infested not only with aliens and their offspring, but also with snakes. After clearing the surface level, Ripley enters a complex where the first boss, a giant, full-grown alien resides. The following level takes place within the complex.</desc>

        <desc>Alpine Ski is an arcade skiing game that features three levels of different alpine events.

The first level is a downhill course in which the player must maneuver his skier around snowmobiles, trees, rocks, ice patches and other skiers while picking up bonus points along the way. The goal is to finish the course in the shortest amount of time possible.

The second level ratchets up the difficulty with a slalom course, which tests both the player's precision and speed. In addition to maneuvering around the same obstacles from the downhill course, the player must also navigate around a series of poles and through a number of flagged gates.

The final level represents an opportunity for bonus points on the ski jumping hill. Players must use the radar provided to maximize their jump distance, being careful not to land and crash into a tree.</desc>

        <desc>You are a hero raised from the dead by the god Zeus to rescue his daughter Athena. With scenery inspired by Ancient Greece, you have to fight hordes of undead and demons, with a boss at the end of each level until you meet the god Neff, who holds the girl captive.

The Altered Beast title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human form.

The game can be played in single player mode, or in same-screen multiplayer co-op mode.</desc>

        <desc>Angleball is a variation on Pool, using a hexagonal table with 6 pockets and 6 sides. The ball can rebound off these at unusual angles, making the outcomes of shots harder to predict. The basic objective is to pot all the balls, while failing to pot a ball in 3 shots will lose you the frame unless your opponent also fails to do this.

The game can be played by one or two players, with the one-player game consisting of a sequence of 20 different table layouts, each requiring its own style to win. Two-player games can take place on any of these layouts or one of your own design using the inbult table editor. Shot direction, speed and spin can be set on a general level.</desc>

        <desc>Agent Captain Blitztek has to find a way through enemy territory to prevent the Axtoatles from taking control of the world. 

Aquattack is an action game with four levels which partly have varying gameplay mechanics. In level one and two, the player mans a motor boat which needs to travel a certain distance from left to right. Of course there is a lot of enemy opposition which needs to be avoided. Some enemies can be shot while others are out of reach. Fuel is limited and needs to replenished by collecting refreshments dropped by allied planes. Level three is similar; the player uses a hang glider now. There are different enemies to fight and no fuel to collect. In level four, there is a guarded energy field to cross in order to bring four bombs to the other side. However, only one bomb can be transported at once and there is a time limit.

After beating all four levels, they loop with more difficult enemies and faster playing speed.  The player can take nine hits and the overall goal is to earn as many points as possible before the unavoidable final death occurs.</desc>

        <desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.

The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.

By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.</desc>

The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.</desc>

        <desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.

The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.

        <name>Auf Wiedersehen Monty (v1.7 special s/l rom)</name>
        <desc>Auf Wiedersehen Monty (German for "Goodbye Monty") is a computer game for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, MSX and Commodore 16. Released in 1987, it is the fourth of the Monty series, following Monty is Innocent, Monty on the Run and the successful original Wanted: Monty Mole. It was written by Peter Harrap and Shaun Hollingworth with music by Rob Hubbard and Ben Daglish.

The player controls Monty as he travels around Europe collecting money in order to buy a Greek island - Montos, where he can safely retire. Gameplay is in the style of a flick-screen platform game, similar to many such games of the 1980s such as Technician Ted and Jet Set Willy. Some screens (such as those representing the Eiffel Tower and the Pyrenees) bear some relation to their real-life counterparts but most are just typical platform game screens.</desc>

But it won't be easy. The Meaning of Life is hidden away; somewhere in a long maze of mountains.
Each mountain is covered with clams and Thor needs to gather 100 clams in order to pay the tolls and advance through each mountain.
The only way to Peter and the toll bridge is through the "real scary caves". There are lots of clams in the caves but watch out for stalagmites. Keep Thor's headlight sweeping back and forth for maximum clams.
Out of the cave, watch out for Grog, who saves clams from Thor.
Thor also has contend with rocks, potholes and pterodactyls (they'll eat his wheel) in his Quest for Clams and the Meaning of Life.</desc>

        <desc>This is the game backgammon and its variant, acey deucey. For backgammon, the standard rules are used. As they are long and complex, if you want to see those rules, look in this manual.

Acey Deucey was a variation created by sailors in the U. S. Navy. As such, the rules for acey deucey will vary from ship to ship and person to person. For Atari, this is the variation used here:

All pieces start out on the central Bar and can be entered at any time with the roll of the dice.

No piece NEEDS to be moved from the bar first, even if it was hit and sent to the bar.

A roll of 1-2 (acey deucey) allows a player to choose whichever doublet s/he wants, after making the 1-2 move.

After moving the doublets, the player is awarded another dice roll.

If, after moving your doublet, the other dice roll is 1-2, you can move the 1-2 and choose another doublet.

Difficulty switches

Right:

A=computer rolls dice for you

B=you can roll real dice and dial in the numbers

Left:

A=computer sets up the board for you

B=you can set the pieces where you want them.

Game variations

Games 1, 3, 5, and 7 are one player

Games 2, 4, 6, and 8 are two player

Games one through four are backgammon

Games five through eight are acey deucey

Games 1, 2, 5, and 6 have a doubling cube.</desc>

        <name>Back to the Future (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>In Back to the Future, 80s teen Marty McFly is mistakenly send 30 years into the past where he disrupts his own parents from meeting. Faced with extinction at the hands of a temporal paradox, Marty must find a way to reunite his future parents and make it back to his own time.

LJN's game differs completely from the computer versions, and plays as a literal race against time broken up by brief arcade minigames. In the main game, the player controls Marty in an overhead view as he runs down the streets of 1950s Hill Valley.  A collection of period-appropriate bad guys block his path, including bullies, hula hoop girls, bumblebees, and park benches.  The camera scrolls forward at a fixed speed, so the player must keep Marty on the move and away from obstacles. Hitting one causes Marty to fall and lose a life. The player must also collect clocks scattered on the street to stop Marty's photograph from fading away.  If it fades completely, Marty is erased from existence.

Street running sections lead to three minigames. In these, Marty must sling milkshakes at oncoming bullies, deflect kisses (shown as hearts) from his mother, and collect notes to rock out on stage at the high school dance. The final stage resembles the street sections, as the player must control the DeLorean time machine and collect enough energy to travel through time (shown as lightning bolts instead of clocks).</desc>

        <name>Balance (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>This German game of dexterity delivers what the title promises. Balance is a lesson in applied gravity: guide a ball to one or more targets by tilting the plane it sits on, much like in those little plastic toys that drive you insane. A simple premise made challenging by tricky, maze-like level layouts that go beyond the &amp;quot;A to B&amp;quot; routine, but require you to touch a certain number of target tiles in no particular order. You must reach all targets in limited time, or else you have to start over. If the ball falls off the edge, one of ten lives is lost. Special fields such as jumpers, accelerators or crumbling tiles test your reflexes; some levels even rotate.

Balance uses vector graphics to draw flat, untextured fields on which the ball rolls. The plane is tilted with the mouse. Every few levels, you get a password to jump directly to that map. Even so, Balance is extremely difficult and only recommended for players with *a lot* of patience.</desc>

        <name>Ballblazer (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>In the year 3037, the most competitive sport in the known universe is Ballblazer. For the first time ever, humans from the planet Earth have won the right to compete in the final round of the Ballblazer Championship, to fight for Earth's honor and the title Masterblazer!

Ballblazer is a 3D futuristic soccer-like game, where the player (inside a Rotofoil) is set on a one-on-one 1,155 square playing field (the Grid). The objective of the player to kick a floating ball (Plasmorb) inside the opponent's goal (Goalbeams). A player may compete against a human or computer opponent.

The Rotofoil is equipped with a multi-purpose forcefield. This forcefield when in short distance of the Plasmorb will act as a pull field, automatically pulling the Plasmorb towards the player. When a player in possession of the Plasmorb shoots, the forcefield will act as push field and launches the ball. When the match starts, the player must move down field and attempt to gain possession of the Plasmorb using the joystick and blast the Plasmorb to an intended direction. 

The player should also be aware that the Goldbeams move slightly every second and the distance between them will shrink. The highest scoring goals are goals made when Goldbeams have disappeared across the horizon (Over The Horizon/OTH shots). A player may also attempt to steal possession of a Plasmorb by rushing beside the opponent and blast the Plasmorb away. The game ends when time runs out or a player wins 10 consecutive goals. If the game ends in a draw, over-time will apply and the first player to score will win the game.

Scoring
Close-in goals - 1 point
Goals near Goldbeams - 2 points
OTH shots - 3 points
Players may steal points from each other by making goals. 
The total combined score of both players cannot accede more than 10 points.
A player winning 10 consecutive points automatically wins the game.

        <desc>Banana is a puzzle game based on the Mole Mole games, where you have to navigate a mole through various levels, making it to the exit. The task is not as simple as it sounds. First, the mole cannot jump or climb up unless there is a ladder nearby. So you have to plan your route ahead, otherwise you can get stuck at the bottom. Second, boulders will fall and block your way. And third, you have a wife. You should first find her, and then lead her securely to the exit. The wife will sometimes make things harder, forcing you to find alternate ways to the exit. But sometimes she'll also be helpful, pushing away boulders and clearing the road for you. 

On every level, there is also various food scattered around, primarily bananas. You'll be able to complete a level if you have gathered enough of those fruits. You'll also gain superpowers from bananas that will allow you to skip level sections that you find too difficult. The entire game is played only with the four directional buttons. There are no enemies and you cannot die - although you can get irrevocably stuck, in which case you'll have to restart a level.</desc>

        <name>Bank Panic (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>As a gunslinger, it's your job to protect a bank from bandits while taking care not to shoot innocent customers. The bank has 12 doors in front of 12 teller windows, with only three doors visible at a time. Shooting is done simply by pressing one of the three buttons to shoot the left, middle or right door. The player can move his viewpoint left and right to reveal new doors. People only appear behind the doors that are currently visible on screen, except for the rare outlaws who will pop up to steal a cash deposit from a teller window the player isn't watching. Indicators at the top of the screen show how much time it will take before someone will show up at a door. 

If a bandit appears behind a door, you have only a few seconds to shoot him before he shoots you. If you shoot him too early (i.e. before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered unfair and gives very little score, but if you're too late, he'll shoot you and you lose one of your three lives. Sometimes a bandit will stick dynamite on one of the doors. You must then shoot the dynamite to get rid of it. If you take too long, the bomb explodes (even if it's offscreen) and you lose a life. 

If you're lucky, a customer will appear behind the door and deposit a bag of gold coins. If you shoot any of these people by accident, you also lose a life. Sometimes a bandit will suddenly take the customer hostage and replace them in the door. 

At other times, a cowboy will appear with a stack of hats. Shooting off all the hats before the door closes grants a cash deposit and a big score bonus. Others will be tied up with rope. If you shoot the rope, there's more money for you, because not only will you receive one bag of gold coins, but you'll get three bags of gold coins. 

There are more than ten rounds in Bank Panic, and each one ends when a person behind all 12 doors was able to throw you a bag of gold coins. The rounds get difficult the further you get. For example, in later rounds, a few bandits will block your shot, and you have to then shoot twice. Also, regardless of what round you're on, there is a time limit.</desc>

        <desc>The TurboGrafx-16 version of Batman: The Video Game is a top-down maze-like game, somewhat similar to Pac-Man or Bomberman.

The game consists of five stages based on the movie: the Streets of Gotham, Flugelheim Museum, AXIS Chemical Factory, the Parade and the Cathedral, where Batman finally faces the Joker. The first four stages are divided into 12 sub-stages or mazes. Each main level has its own objective, which basically consists of finding items in the mazes: collecting &amp;quot;smilex&amp;quot; components in the streets of Gotham, cleaning paintings at the museum, planting bombs at the factory and cutting off the ropes of Joker's balloons at the parade. Before each level, a cutscene with scenes from the movie is displayed.

Batman can attack his enemies with his Batarang. Through the levels, he will collect items which will upgrade his speed and give his Batarang a longer range and multiple shots.</desc>

        <desc>Battle Chopper is a helicopter shooter where the aim is to destroy as many tanks on the ground as you can before you are destroyed. The screen is split into three parts with the main screen showing you looking at your helicopter from behind at a 3rd person perspective flying into the screen showing any tanks on the ground. Another part shows your damage status and score, and finally the third part is where you play and control the game. This part is a radar and it shows the tanks coming down the screen and you control two bars up, down, left or right, and where the bars meet is where your weapon will hit. The tanks will fire missiles upwards at you and you can be hit three times before it is game and this is shown by your helicopter changing colour in your damage status. You have two weapons and they are cannon and missile and you can switch between either.</desc>

        <desc>A dictator took the control of a fortress on the island of Kuhn-Lin.

The player's mission is to storm the island and recapture it. This takes place over the course of six different sequences. The first sequence is Aerial Reconnaissance, where the fleet must be moved directly past the enemy or into a hidden passage to trigger another, optional stage. In this Hidden Passage sequence, the player will have to maneuver around mines and torpedoes. Successfully completing it gives a surprise advantage in the following General Quarters sequence, where the player controls anti-aircraft guns shooting down enemy aircraft.

The next sequence is named Battle Stations and the player must aim and fire heavy guns to hit enemy ships before they inflict too much damage and eventually sink the player's own vessels.  Following this battle, the fleet must be maneuvered to the beach. 
Upon reaching the Beach-Head level, tanks roll out and the player must keep these safe from enemy fire and obstacles while driving. In the Final Battle sequence, the Dictator is holed up in the fortress of Kuhn-Lin and 10 different targets on the fortress must be fired upon to destroy it.

The port for C16 and Plus/4 computers only contains the General Quarters, Battle Stations and Final Battle sequences.</desc>

        <desc>In this game, you have to guide two penguins, one male and one female, through top-down vertical levels. The penguins are in love with each other and must be re-united! The penguins start on opposite sides, separated by walls, bricks, and other obstacles. You take control of one of the penguins. The other makes exactly the same movements as you, but in the opposite direction. So if for example you see an enemy to the left of the penguin you are not controlling, you have to fire to the right in order to hit it. You have to reach the top of the level in such a way that the two penguins will arrive at the top square at the same time, coming from opposite sides. Enemies such as spiders will put web on your way or attack you. You can kill them for points. There are various power-ups that appear randomly on the levels. You should also be careful not to run out of time.</desc>

        <desc>In this game, players control Rodger the Dodger (aka: Blagger), a burglar whose task is to collect a series of keys in a certain location, then use them to open the safe. There are 30 levels to be completed. Blagger must perform these tasks under a time limit while avoiding hazards such as cacti, cars, aliens, mad hatters, giant mouths, and chinamen. Blagger has no weapon to shoot these, but must rely on his jumping skills. He loses a life if he comes into contact with a hazard or falls long distances, or if he runs out of time. As usual, the game ends when all lives are lost. If Blagger successfully grabs the keys and makes his way to the safe, he proceeds to the next location.</desc>

        <desc>As the name suggests, this arcade conversion updates the basic Asteroids gameplay. That means to say that the main gameplay consists of flying through single-screen wrap-around levels shooting at rocks, which split into smaller rocks when hit, eventually becoming small enough to disappear. 

In this case the Asteroids are protecting Mukor, an evil being who is poisoning planets under the Colonising Corp?s control.
Each level is split into either 9 or 16 sub-levels, which are chosen through a square in which any remaining level which is adjacent to the last level completed can be selected. There are 3 different ships (Speeder, Fighter and Warrior), which can be switched between at any time. Power-ups (including improved weapons, shield recharges and a faster thrust) can be collected by flying into them.</desc>

        <desc>Block Hole is a mash-up between a Tetris style game and a shooter. It can be played in single or dual player mode. The game play is very similar, but inferior to Konami's Quarth.

You can move only from right to left while the screen scrolls down. The playing field is filled with different blocks and your aim is to fill them in so they form complete rectangles or squares. Only when you succeed in this mission, the concerned blocks will disappear. New 'unformed' blocks appear while the playing field scrolls down making you play into full action at all times. As soon as a line of blocks reaches the bottom line, it is Game Over.</desc>

Along the way, Joe will encounter various enemies. There are grabbers who will jump on Joe and slow him down. Darth Vader heads who move around more quickly and will shoot at you. Walking grenades will explode when you come too close to them. The green virus will spread around when it is unleashed and it will make you sick when you come into contact with it. Joe will turn pale white, his energy will drain and he can only move around slowly.

Joe can fight back by dropping rocks onto them, or by shooting them or by using mines to blow up enemies or walls.</desc>

You are a man who must collect a set of keys on a level with several floors. You can jump between floors using springboards, which gives you an advantage over your enemies, who must use the ladders to climb between floors. You must also use those in order to descend to a lower floor, mind you. Later levels add touches such as a a ski slope which you must ascend while avoiding the baddies. Hitting them from below will put them out of action, though.</desc>

        <desc>In Fraction Fever, the player's goal is to advance floors up to the twentieth with the help of his pogo stick and the Fraction Elevators located on each floor. To find them, the player needs to look for the correct fraction pictures, matching what is shown at the top of the screen, while a radar shows the layout of floors at the bottom. Incorrect fractions can be knocked down for scoring points, but this leaves holes in the floors. When the player doesn't manage to jump over these and falls down far enough or several times, the game will end. There is also a time limit to look out for, if the clock reaches zero the Fraction Elevator of the current floor cannot be reached, and the player has to jump down a floor to be able to try again.</desc>

In a desperate attempt, you decide to walk to king Ogreth's castle and to defeat him. You hope you'll be able to find some way to bring your soldiers back to you...

In this strategy game, your goal sounds simple ? just walk a distance of 600 meters and defeat king Ogreth. But to do that is not simple at all. Bumping into trees and rocks, king Suren can bring his soldiers to life. Once there are some knights in his small army, he will also be able to free imprisoned soldiers. King Ogreth's units will constantly attack you on the way. The results of the battles are calculated automatically, according to the strength of your units. So before you engage in a battle, you have to be sure you have the upper hand (you have gathered enough soldiers, they have trained in easier battles, etc.). If king Suren dies in a battle, the game is over - you'll have to start from the beginning no matter how near you were to your goal.</desc>

In the game, ZED raids Altile to fight the Xantho empire and destroy its leader, Xur. ZED deploys bombs to clear a path through rocks, walls, and forests, while killing enemies and collecting items. Some gameplay elements resemble those of Bomberman (1983).

RoboWarrior comprises five level formats. In one, the player must obtain a key before the time limit expires. In another, the key is unavailable until the player acquires a crystal or chalice. Some levels are cast in darkness, rendering obstructions invisible unless the player has a lit lamp. Still other levels are mazes in which a player must find and blast-through weak points in walls to proceed. Periodically, a player engages a boss level.</desc>

        <desc>Bomberman was a robot in a bomb making factory who longed for his freedom. Rumors circulated that escaping to the surface would allow the robot to become human. Getting out would be the trick. Each room is inhabited by monsters that must be neutralized and the exit itself hidden underneath bricks.

The first of the Bomberman series, Bomberman is a single-player game with a top down view and simplistic controls. In fact, in addition to movement, the player only has a single ability: placing bombs. Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped blast (four directions) which can destroy either enemies or blocks. Power-ups may be found to increase the size of the blast, place additional bombs, increase the speed of the Bomberman or to walk through walls. The goal on each level is to destroy all enemies and escape through the exit before the time limit is up. Hitting the exit with a bomb blast releases more enemies which must also be destroyed.</desc>

        <desc>You are Rockford, and you have to dig through monster infested caves in search of diamonds. In each level you must collect a certain number of these diamonds, in order to open a portal to the next stage. Enemies can be squashed by falling boulders, which are released when the ground below them is removed or they are pushed onto empty ground, but be careful because these can also squash you. In later levels, difficulty is increased by many puzzle elements and shorter time limits.

There are 16 levels to be completed and five different skill levels available, which affect the number of jewels which must be collected and the time limit.</desc>

        <desc>In Bounder, the player controls a tennis ball that constantly bounces on the screen. 

The player has to move the ball around between two bounces so it lands on friendly areas like grass or the main hexagonal-patterned floor. If it lands  hazardous areas like spikes and sand, or hits the enemies which move around, one of the seven lives the player starts with is lost. There are beneficial squares though - arrows which keep the ball in the air longer or teleports which clear part of the game. 

The 174 screens are divided into 10 levels - at the end of each of these there's a bonus screen.</desc>

        <name>Break In (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>As the title implies, this is a game about breaking into banks, as well as a Break-Out clone.

Each level is a bank, consisting of several rooms. You can only leave a room after your ball hits a key. As a burgler, you are symbolised by a pair of eyes, on top of which a paddle rests. Similarly to Woody Pop, parts of the bottom of the screen is covered up, so that you need not guard the ball as much as in other games. Unlike most Break-Out clones, you can move freely over the entire screen so as to hit the ball at the perfect spot. If you miss the ball and it passes through the void at the bottom, it falls back into the earlier rooms, just like in the Amiga classic, Poing. If you catch it there, you can send it back to the room your were in. In the last room of each bank, you should hit the money that is in there, before you hit the square with a calculator, which will calculate your score for that bank. Later vaults feature a bell which must not be hit, or it will wake a guardian that will hunt you across the screen.

As in all post-Arkanoids, powerups are available, in the shape of a circle that bounces across the screen, all the while changing colours. Depending on which colour it is when you pick it up with your paddle, you get one bonus out of a range which corresponds to the basics of most games in the genre, such as wider paddle, sticky paddle, multiball and firepower.</desc>

        <name>Breaker Breaker (Euro)</name>
        <desc>Although it is a variant of the well-known Break-out, there are still some differences; One of them is that Breaker can be played with two bats. One bat is always at the bottom of the screen and can only move sideways. The other bat can move freely around the screen, but can not reach the bottom of the screen. The upper bat is the attacker sending the ball to the desired point, while the other one is the back up. If it is played by one player the second bat can be placed vertically; they always move sideways, only the upper one moves up and down. If it is played by two players each one gets one bat.

The other difference is the screen layout. Not only the screen is filled with special stones, but also with walls in different shapes that form a maze. Against these walls the ball just bounces, but if there is an opening at the top of the screen, allowing the ball to escape from the screen, the whole screen moves up a bit. While what is at the bottom of the image will disappear, a new piece appears at the top. At the bottom of the screen is the score, game level, the number of balls and the four bonus stones lights. 

There are five different stones; the first one is the familiar, colorful type; depending on the color, it is worth many points or just a few points. The second is the action stone, characterized by an arrow. This one acts like a flipper-bumper and gives the ball a push in the direction indicated to confuse the player. The last is the shrinkage/expansion stone; if hit, the bats become bigger or smaller. You also have the bonus stones in four colors. If you always touch one of the bonus stones of the same color, a light with that color will light up or go out at the bottom of the image. If all four of the same color lights are on, the player gets an extra ball. The special stones causes that the attack bat temporarily disappears. 

In the configuration screen the player(s) can set up the number of players and the controls; joystick, keyboard or mouse. The entire screen can also be moved with the controls.</desc>

        <desc>The late martial arts hero features in this platform game, with the aim of reaching a wizard in an underground lair, defeat of whom can offer him untold wealth. 

In each area you must collect the many strategically-placed lanterns before exiting through the newly-revealed passageway. Some rooms also have escalator-type sections to run along, and the standard (although slightly illogical in this context) ladders.  There are 20 areas to be completed.

On the way, you'll fight two enemies - a ninja and a green sumo warrior named Yamo. You can defeat them by punching, kicking, dropping on their heads or luring them into hazardous terrain, or even by making them accidentally hit each other. Even after they are killed, however, they keep coming back for more after a few seconds. The game also allows a second player to take control of Yamo.

There are lots of hazards to avoid by either walking round or jumping - walls of electrical charge and exploding bushes for example.</desc>

        <desc>The wizard tyrant Vadra has enslaved the inhabitants of the ancient city of Irkon and made them into immobile blobs.
To further strengthen his grip of the city, he has created giant bottles that spew magical bubbles that create mutant enemies that enforce his control. 
His former assistant Kintor has given you the ability to move and created magical corks that can be used to close the bottles to lessen Vadra's grip. Your task is to cork the bottles and overthrow the evil wizard.

The player controls a blob or bubble that can roll, jump, use chutes and elevators to move around a 3D system of platforms, towers and slopes. Enemies can be shot with mini bubbles, crabs spawn from generators and bubbles come from the bottles, five of which have to be corked on each level allowing the player to exit it. Since the player bubble has no features, a directional gauge is used to determine the facing of the bubble to show movement direction.</desc>

        <desc>Budokan is a martial arts game covering Karate (unarmed combat), Kendo (using a wooden sword), Nunchaku (using piercing chain weapons) and Bo (using a staff). The player has a realistic range of moves and must use them wisely, as Ki (life-force) is drained for every move made, whether successful or not, and both this and your stamina level must be kept high.

You can practice your skills alone, or spar against the instructors or your friends. Finally, when you feel you are ready, you can travel to the martial arts world championship tournament at Budokan.</desc>

        <desc>You play as Chef Pepper and your goal is to make giant hamburgers while evil eggs, sausages and pickles chase you around the game area. 

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step over every burger ingredient. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also &amp;quot;bump&amp;quot; any other ingredient below it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud that will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.

Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble.</desc>

        <desc>El CapitÃ¡n Trueno (Captain Thunder) is the name of a famous Spanish comic book which tells the ongoing story of the eponymous 12th-century hero. This is the first game dealing with the character, released to all of the Spanish-speaking world's most vital computing platforms at the time: ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX and MS-DOS; all ports except for the PC version contain two different segments, the first a calmer adventure portion followed by some frenetic arcade action.

The final mission is to rescue Sigrid, Trueno's beloved, from the monastery of his friend Abbot Estanislao de Castiglione. Along the way, the CapitÃ¡n will have to face giant spiders, skeleton soldiers, enormous rats and a plethora of imaginative creatures such as the Abbot transformed into a demonic goat. The CapitÃ¡n strives to triumph over all these opponents with the assistance of his friends sturdy Goliath, who though immobile can lash out with meaty fists and jump in place to cause earthquakes, and nimble CrispÃ­n, a man who can shimmy up a rope of any length.</desc>

In this game, which can be played by one or two players, you control a car and compete with three other cars in an squared arena. Your goal is to destroy the other three cars by crashing into them on the side. A head-on collision has no effect.
When all three other cars have been taken out of competition you advance to the next level.
In some levels the arena can contain a ramp, which can be used to jump on other cars or a pond in the middle in which you can try to push the other cars to take them out of the competition.

All this has to be done before you run out of fuel. If any fuel left then you'll receive bonus points.</desc>

        <desc>Chack'n Pop is considered  a predecessor of  Bubble Bobble. It is a platform game where a roundish yellow creature, named Chack'n, must fight against Monstas and Mightas in order to reclaim hearts that were stolen during a romantic encounter with Miss Chack'n.

The Monstas themselves hatch from eggs hanging from the ceilings and the Mightas push a rock that is used as the game's timer. The Monsta eggs have three phases:  if it's blue, it's completely harmless, if it's yellow it will pop within 10 seconds and if an egg turns red it will pop almost immediately.

Chack'n uses bombs to blow up the Monstas and their eggs and he also uses them to release the captured hearts from their cages. When the heart is released, it will fly up and destroy the separator block and reveal the exit to the level.

Most versions of the game contain 14 levels to play through, however the Famicom version only includes 9.</desc>

        <desc>As an undercover agent of Chase Headquarters, your job is to patrol the streets and track down five criminals. You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. 

However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a &amp;quot;suspicion&amp;quot;.

        <desc>You are Eliot, on the trail of the gangsters who dominate Chicago in the 1930s. They lurk in the docks, on the streets and in an alcohol distillery, armed with guns and grenades, and must be taken out. 

Gameplay is side-view and takes place on a number of vertical levels, with a feel similar to Green Beret. Jump and duck to target and avoid crooks. Later you spend time inside a car, and can lean out of the window to shoot people. Watch out for enemy cars, which can only be destroyed using grenades.</desc>

        <desc>Macross: Countdown (released outside of Japan as just Macross) is a side-scrolling shoot'em up based on the classic anime series. Players control a Valkyrie fighter that launches from the Macross to rescue Lynn Minmay from the Zentradi. Many waves of enemies must be overcome by evading or shooting at them. A radar at the bottom of the screen displays incoming enemies and obstacles. As in the series, the Valkyrie can transform into one of three different modes, but cannot fire any weapons while transforming: in Fighter mode, it is fast and maneuverable. Speed and maneuverability are lower in Gerwalk mode, which can be useful for getting through tight spots. In Battroid mode, the Valkyrie's projectiles are self-seeking. Only in Fighter and Gerwalk modes, the Valkyrie can launch a powerful missile spread that can take out a lot of enemies at once. The spread is limited to three firings per wave, though. </desc>

A radar at the bottom of the screen displays incoming enemies and obstacles. As in the series, the Valkyrie can transform into one of three different modes, but cannot fire any weapons while transforming: in Fighter mode, it is fast and maneuverable. Speed and maneuverability are lower in Gerwalk mode, which can be useful for getting through tight spots. In Battroid mode, the Valkyrie's projectiles are self-seeking. Only in Fighter and Gerwalk modes, the Valkyrie can launch a powerful missile spread that can take out a lot of enemies at once. The spread is limited to three firings per wave, though. </desc>

        <desc>You are Charlie, a member of a circus troupe. Your job is to please the crowd by performing five death-defying stunts:

Stunt #1: You and the lion must jump through several rings of fire. Remember to avoid the jugs that emit fire. You must do this for 100 meters.

Stunt #2: Walk the tightrope for 70 meters, avoiding the monkeys that get in your way. Jump the cyan monkeys for 500 points.

Stunt #3: Roll on a ball for 80 meters, jumping from ball to ball. You can move balls backwards if the target is too close to make a successful jump. Avoid contact with the ground.

Stunt #4: Ride a horse for 200 meters, bouncing on trampolines along the way. Be careful not to miss the jump or go over the tops of trampolines. You can speed up or slow down the horse.

Stunt #5: Finally, trapeze from swing to swing for 50 meters. If you miss, make sure that you land on the platforms below so you bounce back on a swing.

Once you have completed all five stunts, you have to do them again and hopefully, more points will be awarded.</desc>

Both men are trying to win the affection of the beautiful Calia - but the unscrupulous Nerio has denounced Benurio and forced him to race in the Circus Maximus. However, chariot racing is a rough business and the other participants will try to kill you before the end of the race...

You must complete four hazardous races in each of which you'll have to complete four laps, avoiding the obstacles and fighting off your opponents. They will carry weapons of increasing deadliness with which they'll try to reduce your energy, these could be hatchets (the basic weapon), but also swords, mallets, tridents, nets or lances. You can obtain anyone of them when beating its carrier.</desc>

        <desc>The subtitle &amp;quot;The moving puzzle game&amp;quot; should be interpreted literally; this is a puzzle game where the picture on the puzzle pieces are constantly animated. This can make piecing together the pieces quite difficult, or at least call for strategies not used in conventional puzzles.

There are ten puzzles to choose from, and these can be divided into anything from 2x2 to 12x8 pieces. The pieces are not only scattered, they may also be turned upside down. 

As you play the puzzle, your score starts to count down, and the rate of the countdown is heightened when you execute moves, turn the pieces or use the special features which will reveal a glimpse of the finished puzzle, automatically lay out pieces, or halt the animation. If the score reaches zero, the game is over.</desc>

        <desc>Congo Bongo is an arcade platform game similar in many ways to Donkey Kong, but with an isometric perspective. The player takes control of a safari hunter who is searching for an ape named Bongo, determined to punish him for setting the hunter's tent on fire. The game consists of four one-screen stages, each with an objective to jump on platforms and reach the top. Various animals will try to stop the protagonist: for example, in the first level a large gorilla throws coconuts at him. The hero has no offensive abilities and must jump or otherwise avoid enemy attacks. Stages may contain obstacles or hazardous spots that would kill off the main character.</desc>

        <name>Corsarios (Spanish)</name>
        <desc>As the name indicates, Corsarios is a game focused on sea affairs, which consists of two independent parts. On the first one, you will be on a wild island, a place in which we will have to face endless hordes of pirates whose only obsession will be killing us. Some of them will use all kind of deadly weapons, such as the famous saber or a blunderbuss. Luckily for us and unfortunately for them, our protagonist is quite capable when it comes to fight with punches and kicks. So if all goes well, you will find a small boat which is awaiting you at the other extreme of the island.

The second part, to which we can access without the need of finishing the first one, takes place in a pirate galleon. There we will have to represent the role of the hero once again and we should try to rescue the beautiful damsel. Now the game system is quite different from the first part, because we will be no longer able to directly blow our enemies, but we will have to use a sword to finish with all of them. The objective consists in ascending to the pirate flags which are in the different masts of the ship and, in the end, to arrive where the girl is before she ends being food for sharks.</desc>

Cuando se dirigían hacia un asteroide donde se habían encontrado importantes yacimientos de berkelio, se cruzaron con una inmensa flota bélica pictia que se dirigía a gran velocidad hacia la Tierra, y no con buenos propósitos precisamente. Al ser descubiertos, fueron atacados por cazas pictios. Afortunadamente, los daños no fueron excesivos, exceptuando la pérdida de memoria por parte del ordenador, lo que les impedía poder regresar a no ser que encontraran unos discos con los que elaborar la carta astral necesaria para descubrir el camino de vuelta.

«Cyberbig» es un simpático arcade dotado de unos gráficos muy coloristas y una gran cantidad de efectos especiales que le hacen muy atractivo a la vista. Por lo demás su desarrollo rápido y movido asegura el entretenimiento y la diversión.</desc>

All this boils down to a Jetpac-influenced game where you fly your ship around a hostile planet, at first picking up pieces of your ship in order to make it fully functional, then finding resources. You have a laser gun and a plasma weapon at your disposal to fight the enemies which float around or are actively hunting you. The sky is also filled with dangers such as acid rain clouds, hovering lasers and meteor showers. The undulating terrain is equally dangerous.</desc>

This task is not easy, as en route you will face heavy opposition forces. Fortunately, you won't be a sitting bomber in the air. Your aircraft is equipped with machine guns (left and right) with unlimited rounds of fire power, so fire at will as the enemy approaches.

When the time comes, you will have to bomb the target manually. So, get ready to unload the cargo and give them hell!</desc>

        <desc>The actor Charles Bronson played the iconic role of vigilante Paul Kersey in 5 movies where he takes the law into his own hands when he doesn't get justice and criminals get off.  This game is based on Death Wish 3 which came out in 1985.  A friend of Kersey in New York has been killed and he takes to the streets to help the police lay waste to gangs that are brutalizing and rioting in the city.

He has a bulletproof vest that will protect him from several shots and can wield 4 guns: the 475 Wildey Magnum, shotgun, machine gun, and rocket launcher.  Avoid shooting grannies on the streets, mean street-walkers and the police who occasionally will help you take out the baddies.  If you start shooting policemen, they will turn on you too.    
The upper half of the screen shows you the side-view of the street or building you are in.  The lower half shows your score, high score, injury meter, a scrolling police report so you can know where crime is taking place, a compass direction, a map which will also show you where weapons and bosses are located, and which weapon you are holding and the ammo left.  
When you enter a building, you can fire out the window for higher points but beware of enemies that may come up behind you.</desc>

        <name>Decathlon (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>Decathlon is a 1-2 player sports game combining ten athletics track and field events.
The game can be played as single events or in a full 10 event competition against the computer or/and a human opponent.

The competing events in the game are the normal: 100m sprint race, 400m dash, 1500m run,
110m hurdles, long jump, high jump, pole vault, shot put, discus throw and javelin throw.

Players can select their country (and the opponents) from eight predefined: UK, France, Germany, Austria, USA, Canada, Japan, Taiwan.
The competitors names are not changeable, e.g. 'Tommy' will always compete for the UK.

Only two players (human or computer) compete against each other in every event, so even if in the 1500m run four characters are running on the track; the two extras are just filling out the field, creating a tripping hazard for the two actual competitors.

Each character has a stamina/power that affects his performance, so the player has to keep within the avatars limits, or he gets too tired.

After a single race, the player gets the option of trying again, or ending the event.

In a full decathlon, a points table is filled in as the events progress.</desc>

        <name>Deep Dungeon II - Yuushi no Monshou (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>YÅ«shi no MonshÅ is the sequel to Deep Dungeon: MadÅ Senki. Hundreds of years have passed, the spirit of the long forgotten evil Emperor Ruu has returned. A hero claiming to be the descendant of the previous hero Raru appears in the town of Dorl, and sets on exploring a tower in order to defeat Ruu.

The game consists of an eight level tower, four of which are underground, while the others are above ground, the underground levels having a higher difficulty than the latter. The game plays like its predecessor, the player exploring the tower in a first-person view, fighting monsters and improving the hero's skills along the way. When the hero levels up, he gains points to be attributed to his different stats rather than having them distributed automatically. When the hero's level is significantly higher than that of the monsters on the level, random battles are suspended; only the battles triggered by stepping on specific spaces have to be fought. The game has two endings, one being a secret good ending.</desc>

One day, Sharudo came and took princess Chris to his monster lair. Now it's up to Ares, a brave soldier in the service of the Fairies, to save Chris.

Demon Crystal is an action puzzle game. Scattered around the stage are numerous keys which help open locked areas. The goal is to find the big key which is needed to open the exit and advance to the next stage. Ares' only weapon is a limited number of bombs, which explode in a flame and can kill multiple enemies at once. The game consists of 30 stages (houses).</desc>

        <desc>Gun.Smoke is a top-down scrolling shooter that casts the gamer as a lone gunman, out to save the gold rush town of Hicksville from a fearsome group of bandits known as the Wingates. Each level has a particular target enemy, although his or her henchmen must also be taken out.

Although it largely takes place on foot, the gameplay resembles Commando, with its top-down action. The screen scrolls at a constant rate, and enemies come at you from the edges, to be shot or avoided. You can grab various power-ups along the way. Finding a horse will allow you to get hit twice before you die rather than just once. There are scenes in which you raft up a river and use the tracks of a railway line.

On the NES you can tap the A button to fire up and right, the B button to fire up and left, or A and B simultaneously to fire straight ahead. One-button control systems mimic all this.</desc>

        <desc>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves). Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.

        <desc>Something tells you that the meat pulp with eyes that you've seen lying around in a corner of the professor's study, must be the professor himself. After exiting the mansion, you've met a multitude of horrible beings around its surroundings. So the professor most probably invoked the evil forces and they thanked him by using his bones for a barbecue. Another guy would pack his bag and go home or drinking, but that's not the kind of person you are. The only way you can think about to stop the evil forces, is putting the scroll to fire. But the musical notes went out flying and something tells you that it will be worthless if you burn the scroll without those notes. So you're prepared to collect all music notes and put them back into the scroll. And then you'll take it back to the same forge where the professor invoked the beings for the beyond. The bad news is that you have no idea where the notes have fallen, and the good news is that the scroll's treble clef will signal their proximity.</desc>

Door Door is a platform game in which Chun has to lock up the alien creatures that pursue him. Chun can attempt to lock as many aliens as he can behind each door that is available on a particular stage. Chun can slide open a door, wait for the alien(s) to enter and then he has to quickly shut the door, because if he waits to long the captured aliens will walk out and pursue him again. Each stage is completed when all the enemy aliens are trapped behind doors.</desc>

        <desc>Set in a post-apocalyptic New York, Double Dragon is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers trained in the fighting style of Sou-Setsu-Ken. Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the &amp;quot;Black Warriors&amp;quot;, a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.

Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.

The NES version of this game also has an additional VS. fighting mode for one or two players. Players choose from a field of six different characters (Billy and 5 of the enemy characters) and enter into a one-on-one fighting match. Players have to punch, kick, jumpkick, and even use a weapon against their opponents until someone's health bar is fully drained. The winner is the last one standing.</desc>

        <name>Dragon Slayer (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>Dragon Slayer is commonly considered one of the progenitors of the action RPG genre. The premise is similar to Roguelikes: the player takes control of a knight who must fight his way through large overhead maze-like dungeons. Unlike roguelikes, the combat in the game is fully action-oriented: the player must approach the monster and &amp;quot;bump&amp;quot; into it in order to inflict damage, at the same time trying to avoid its blows. Combat takes place on the same screen as the exploration; monsters will also sometimes pursue the knight if he attempts to escape. Also contrary to roguelikes, none of the locations or items in the game is randomized.

The player can collect power stones and coins during the journey; the power stones increase the hero's strength, while the coins increase his hit points (health). Defeating enemies also yields experience points, which determine the amount of maximum HP the hero is able to receive. The knight is able to cast magic spells, though they are mostly used outside of combat, for example breaking walls, teleporting, or creating a map of the area.</desc>

        <name>Dragon Slayer IV - Drasle Family (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>Long ago, an evil dragon named Keela was imprisoned inside a magical dungeon. However time has passed and the magic that sealed the dragon away is weakening. The Drasle family decides that it's time to destroy the dragon once and for all. However only one weapon is capable of doing this, the Dragon Slayer, which is itself sealed away by four magical crowns. The Drasle family decides to take on this quest, and will use every member of the family in order to accomplish it.
The player chooses a character from among five different members of the Drasle family. The choices are: Xemm the father and woodcutter, Mayna the magic-using mother, Roas the brave warrior son, Lyll the athletic daughter and Pochi the domesticated monster-pet. Each character has unique abilities (including attack and jumping abilities) and can only use certain items from those collected. Players can travel back to the Drasle household at any point to change characters.

The object of the game is to enter the large dungeon, itself divided into 5 areas, collecting a variety of items (which as mentioned, can only be used by particular characters) and use them to progress through the dungeon, defeating monsters. Power-ups dropped by monsters include gold, keys, health-restoring bread, magic-restoring potions and health-damaging poison. Gold can be spent on items and other power-ups that are available at various shops hidden inside the dungeon. The player must eventually defeat the four bosses guarding the crowns that seal the Dragon Slayer and then use that weapon to defeat the Kress.</desc>

        <desc>Driller Tanks features a side-on view of the tank you control, which is submerged in a maze full of nasties known as Mammuts and Skorks. The aim is to first shoot them, then run them over, within a limited period of time before they wake up and reactivate. 

You must walk through a particular section of maze to make it accessible for this, as any shot fired into the initial blue barriers will have no effect. At all times you must watch to ensure that none of the Mammuts reach the palace by travelling to the top of the screen. The Skorks are less harmful, but contact with them in their unfrozen state is still fatal, and they refill areas you have cleared.</desc>

You travel your way through forests, dungeons, and caverns, and some graveyards at the end of a level. Each setting offered a slightly different variety of enemies. Enemies encountered are of the standard type found in most early games of the genre, such as bats and skeletons.  To help navigate through the maze-like levels, a map is available for access. The entire game is played using the gun joystick so that movement is also done by shooting on the arrows onscreen.</desc>

You are the coach!

You device the strength of the opposing team. You decide how long the game will be. There are a wide range of formation tactics to choose from. The game is fast and exciting.

The rules are almost the same as in a real-life game, but you can make variations.

This is the first time ever that RPG (role-playing game) software has been available in a video sports game.

Once airborne, you can shoot all aliens. But remember, there is only a limited supply of fuel on board! You must shoot all aliens before you run out of fuel.
After you've shot all aliens you have to get your space craft back on the ground to refuel for another mission.</desc>

        <desc>Eagles 5 is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up loosely based on the Japanese anime series Gatchaman. Characters from the anime are featured on the game's cover and in the background story; however, in the game itself the player controls a spaceship flying through deep space levels with identical background. The ship is protected by a shield, which effectively grants it a HP bar. Power-ups that upgrade the ship's weaponry can be found in the stages. However, the weapon reverts to its default shape when the ship is hit by the enemy. There are no continues in the game: when the ship's hit points are depleted, the game must be restarted from the beginning.</desc>

        <desc>The Eggerland series consists of several puzzle games. You play Lolo, a blue ball-like character with eyes, arms, and legs. The story mainly deals with King Egger, the villain, who has captured princess Lala, who is similar to Lolo, only colored red. It is up to Lolo to rescue Lala by travelling through Egger's domain and solving the puzzle rooms laid out before him.
You must guide Lolo through a room of tiles and collect all of the Heart Framers in the room. Doing this opens up a Jewel Box, which contains an item. Successfully acquiring the contents of the Jewel Box will clear the room of all monsters and open the way to the next room(s). Luckily for you Lolo has a weapon: the Magic Shot. Two shots can be obtained by collecting certain Heart Framers.
There are other types of obstacles in the levels, as well, such as water and Emerald Framers (green blocks that Lolo may push around freely).</desc>

        <name>Elevator Action (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>You are Agent 17 (codename: &amp;quot;Otto&amp;quot;). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.

Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them:
Shooting them with his gun.
Kicking them by jumping onto them.
Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.
Crushing them with an elevator.
Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.

While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall. 

Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.

Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.

If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.</desc>

There are dozens of enemies and two types of shooting: slow and fast. Two weapon systems: one slow double-shot cannon and one fast single-shot cannon.
With each enemy hit by the slow cannon you get one shot added to the fast cannon ammunition supply.
A challenge stage follows each stage in which you can build up your fast-shot bullet supply.</desc>

        <desc>F-1 Spirit: The Way To Formula-1 is a top down Formula One Racing game, developed and published by Konami, which was released for the MSX in Japan and Europe in 1987. The game engine is very similar to Konami's Road Fighter. It also features Konami's custom sound chip called Konami SCC (a five-channel chip that compliments the three-channel PSG chip of the MSX computer system, or in other words, a sound custom chip that brings five voices more to the three voices of the PSG sound chip on the system), and great MSX1 graphics to go with it. It was one of the first ROM on MSX with this sound feature. Together with its "3D" spinoff (F-1 Spirit: 3D Special), F-1 Spirit: The Way To Formula-1 was the most extended racing game Konami released for the MSX.</desc>

You will need to take the form of a dolphin and a bird in order to locate the pieces that are hidden in the ocean and clouds. When flying in the air, there are several screens that have clouds flying by. Touch all of the clouds, and the trident piece appears! Other birds which are flying around will cause you to lose energy if you touch them accidentally. Underwater, trident pieces can be found by touching the sea horses. Octopuses, sharks, and a deadly maze of seaweed will get in your way and cause you to lose energy if caught! When you have located all of the trident pieces, the cage holding Neptina can be unlocked, but if you run out of energy first the game will be over.</desc>

The goal of the game seems to be to stop some kind of missile attack. At the beginning of the game you need to select two members of your team, out of five options available. Statistics of these members are presented during the opening credits of the game.

The gameplay is sluggish, and your team members take a fixed formation which is actually a hindrance to get past obstacles as they will not get out of formation and prevent you from moving forward. The enemies seem to be being spawned at random, as such it is critical to keep moving forward as fast as possible avoiding them as much as you can.</desc>

        <desc>In this platform game you control a mouse who is a fire fighter and that has to rescue mice out of an burning apartment building.

You have to pick up the mice and bring them safely to the left side of the building where the steel fire escape stairs are located.
When all the mice have left the building trough the emergency exit at the bottom-right of the screen it is your turn to leave the building by using the stairs that appear randomly on the lowest platform level.
You progress to the next level when you have left the building.

The shape of the platform changes each level and also fire balls will appear making it more difficult to you to rescue the mice. When a fire burns too long on a particular part of floor that floor will disappear and don't get caught by the fire or you'll lose a life.</desc>

        <name>Fire Rescue (Jpn, Alt)</name>
        <desc>In this platform game you control a mouse who is a fire fighter and that has to rescue mice out of an burning apartment building.

You have to pick up the mice and bring them safely to the left side of the building where the steel fire escape stairs are located.
When all the mice have left the building trough the emergency exit at the bottom-right of the screen it is your turn to leave the building by using the stairs that appear randomly on the lowest platform level.
You progress to the next level when you have left the building.

The shape of the platform changes each level and also fire balls will appear making it more difficult to you to rescue the mice. When a fire burns too long on a particular part of floor that floor will disappear and don't get caught by the fire or you'll lose a life.</desc>

        <desc>In this puzzle game, you control Flappy, a yellow mole.  The object of the game is to help Flappy push the Blue Stone onto its Blue Platform in each level.

Red Stones are placed in key locations across the levels.  They can be pushed, stacked on top of each other, and even destroyed.  Flappy must strategically take advantage of the gravity and the Red Stones in order to clear the path for pushing the Blue Stone.  Three different types of enemies will try to prevent Flappy from clearing the level, so you must either avoid the enemies, crush them from above with the Stones, or pick up Sleeping Mushrooms to knock them out temporarily.</desc>

        <name>Flashpoint (Kor)</name>
        <desc>Flash Point is inspired by the arcade game Robotron. The story is that an alien fleet landed in the capital city of the United World Nations and the player has to defend it for as long as possible using a tank.

The gameplay is divided in two main screens. The first screen is the city map, which shows the areas being attacked by the aliens as flashing points (hence the game's name). The areas will flash faster as time passes by, until they are completely destroyed or until the player moves to that area to defend it. Once the player reaches one of those areas, the game changes to the second screen, which shows the tank in the center of a green park area, with buildings around it. There are several aliens in this area, which will start homing the player, destroying the terrain in their way. The player has to destroy them as quick as possible, trying to save as much terrain (specially the central green area) as possible for a higher score. Once all aliens are destroyed, the player is sent back to the map screen to select another area. Moving in the map screen is faster on streets, slower on other ground types.

The tank is controlled using both joysticks, one for movement and one for shooting in all eight possible directions. The game was released with a frame to hold both joysticks together. The player has 3 lives and one extra life is earned for each 30,000 points scored. The game has also a high score table.</desc>

        <name>Flight Simulator - Gyorai Kougeki (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>The conception of the Flight Simulator computer game series, still going strong today, began in the late 1970's with &amp;quot;FS1&amp;quot;, created by Bruce Artwick of subLOGIC and released in early 1980.  First came the Apple ][, with a very scaled down instrument panel on bottom and outside/radar view on top, then the TRS-80, with mere 128x48 monochrome graphics and thus numbers and bars replacing the panel.  

There was only one aircraft and one region: a 6x6 grid with &amp;quot;mountains&amp;quot;.  The user could press &amp;quot;W&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;declare war&amp;quot;, entering the WW1 &amp;quot;British Ace&amp;quot; game mode.  The objective was to shoot down enemy planes and bomb their base.

Both the Apple ][ and TRS-80 versions originally came on cassette tape.  The Apple ][ version was updated in 1981 with minor improvements.

Note that the first PC version, Microsoft Flight Simulator (v1.0), was released two years later and is more similar to the 8-bit versions of Flight Simulator II.</desc>

        <desc>Your task in this arcade game is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away from their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</desc>

        <desc>Your task in this arcade game is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away from their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</desc>

        <desc>Front Line is a vertically scrolling action game. Your mission is to infiltrate enemy territory and destroy their fortress. To reach the fortress, you will have to make your way through varied and dangerous terrain. Jungles, deserts, brush, and rocks all slow your progress, plus each area has numerous enemy fighters and tanks trying to stop you. To help get past these obstacles, you are armed with a machine gun and grenades; at some points in the game you may even come across an abandoned tank which you can control to increase your odds of survival. When you reach the end of the level and successfully destroy the fortress, the game will repeat at a higher level of difficulty. Gameplay is for one or two players, and four different skill levels are available.</desc>

        <name>Fruit Panic (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>Fruit Panic is a platform game with some similarities to Mappy, albeit single-screen like Bomb Jack. Controlling Walky, a yellow ball with legs, you must pick up all fruit strewn across the platforms, while hunted by the Nyankys. Walky can't jump between platforms, so the only way to reach another platform, and more fruit, is to walk off the platform and go to one of the trampolines placed on the left and right of the screen. During his walk, Walky is a prone target for the Nyankys, who will hunt him from all directions. Walky's only defence is to drop on the head of a Nyanky, and his ability to lay bombs, of which he has a limited supply. Only one bomb may be laid at any time, preventing you from covering the screen in bombs. Jumping too many times on the trampoline will make it burst, costing Walky one life. When all fruit are picked, the game proceeds to the next level, with new platforms and another kind of fruit.

Fruit Panic has been remade in 1990 as the Game Boy game Tasmania Story.</desc>

        <desc>Galaga is a vertical arcade shooter from Namco.  You control a space fighter at the bottom of the screen, scrolling left and right in order to avoid oncoming bombs and kamikaze attacks from alien invaders--and to fire your own missiles to fight back!

There are an infinite number of stages to progress through.  Every third level is a &amp;quot;challenge stage&amp;quot; in which you have a free chance to shoot as many aliens as possible and rack up bonus points.

Certain aliens have tractor beams they can use to capture one of your ships.  If that wasn't your last &amp;quot;life,&amp;quot; you can try to shoot that alien down and recapture your ship, giving you two ships at once and doubling your firepower.

A summary screen appears when the game is over, giving you both your final score and you final &amp;quot;hit ratio&amp;quot;--the number of missiles fired, enemies destroyed, and the percentage of targets hit.</desc>

Unlike many similar games (such as Demon Attack or Phoenix) your ship can move about the entire screen and is not limited to horizontal only movement. On each level has there is a timer; if time runs out and you haven't finished destroying all of the enemies, the next level will begin, however all of the remaining enemies from the previous level will remain on the screen (so you now have two sets of enemies to destroy at once). There are many different types of enemies to destroy which become faster and more numerous as the levels progress.</desc>

        <desc>In a distant lost Galaxy in the immensity of the Universe, a gorgeous and evil woman had put under her with her intelligence and an immense army of Terminators of the five planet confederations located beyond Alpha Centauri. All the power of Gremla rested in the almost religious fidelity of her lieutenant Arkos; nevertheless, the intelligence of this Mega-Terminator of battle had evolved on the last ultraguarks in such a way that, finally, he left Gremla and he was united to the troops of the sidereal infantry, who commanded the general of the blue star Mc Killer.

As far as the game in itself, it's frenetic arcade divided in two parts, in which when it stops to arrive at second, you needed a key access that you obtained at the end of first.</desc>

        <desc>Gauntlet is an action game where players choose characters and fight their way through hordes of enemies that assault them on the way to the end of the level. One or two players must make their way through 100 levels of mayhem and magic. 

The game features a choice of four characters to play with, each with different weapons. Thor the Warrior has a bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the Valkyrie has a close range sword, Questor the Elf has his long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has magical bolts.

Ghosts, goblins and even the life-draining Death are among the enemies. Enemies stream out of generators, so destroy these before tackling the rest. 

Keys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain only bonus items, not a progressive route.  Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces the character's energy level.

        <desc>They never took the Dork menace very seriously. First they thought they would never dare to attack, then that we would easily beat them... mankind never learns. Now the Earth is invaded by those creatures, and you are the pilot in charge of saving everyone. Does it sound familiar to you? Maybe one of those combat simulators said something similar.

Your mission is quite simple: kill as many enemies as possible, while trying to stay alive. First, you must escape from Earth, to visit five planets and get a part of the Genesis on each one. Once you have successfully assembled the spaceship, you will use it to get back to Earth and free us from the Dork menace.</desc>

        <name>Ghostbusters (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>Based on the 1984 film of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call to &amp;quot;bust&amp;quot; any ghost hauntings. They do this through the use of nuclear-accelerated &amp;quot;proton packs&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ghost traps&amp;quot;, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility at their Headquarters. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly and dramatically increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal psychokinetic energy, the &amp;quot;PK level&amp;quot; in the city, which represents ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and resurrects an evil goddess called Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that features an overhead-view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor a map of midtown Manhattan for &amp;quot;ghost alarms&amp;quot;, as well as for casual, roaming spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. Once the route is plotted, the player then controls the purchased Ghostmobile as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. When the haunted location is reached, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the Ghostbusters will take position, activate their proton beams, and toss a trap to the ground. The player must then use the two Ghostbusters to attempt to lead the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap springs to capture any ghosts directly above it. A successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for it. An unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away (after nastily sliming one of the Ghostbusters).

As the game progresses, the PK energy in the city increases. The Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at busting ghosts. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</desc>

Since the airplane naturally seeks the floor it is necessary to use the wind coming from floor vents to gain height. Obstacles that have to be avoided include tables, candles and electrical outlets. Good items to touch are clocks which give points and sheets of paper which give extra gliders. If touching any obstacles the glider is lost. The number of gliders available is by default four but can be set from one to six. </desc>

        <desc>Once the player gets past the title screen, the game will begin. The movement of Godzilla is in three dimensions, and Godzilla's only weapon is his atomic breath, which can be aimed. Godzilla has four lives, which are depleted by either the enemies touching Godzilla, hitting Godzilla with their attacks, or Godzilla falling into a hole.

Megalon will dig holes in the ground and come up to the surface to get Godzilla. After defeating Megalon, Kumongas will come up from the holes and fire at Godzilla with one of two weapons; a string shot or a color-changing projectile. After defeating several Kumongas, King Ghidorah appears and Godzilla has to defend Minilla. King Ghidorah shoots his gravity beams near himself, and if Minilla touches King Ghidorah, Godzilla loses a life. After defeating Ghidorah, the game restarts.

The 2-Player mode is the same as the one player mode except that two players can alternate between each life, each with their own lives and score meters. (godzilla.wikia.com)</desc>

? In the first one, Gonzalez must escape his own nightmare. He moves by executing precise jumps in one big level divided in seven sections, a surreal landscape littered with dangerous objects like flying vacuum-cleaners, disembodied hands, etc. The Q key is the jump button, while the O and P move him left and right respectively.


 ? In the second load, Gonzalez must find his hammock while avoiding the dangers of a stereotypical Mexican landscape (Indian tribes, wild animals, etc). Weapons and ammunition are scattered in one large level divided in sections. He can collect or drop these by crouching with the A key and can use them with the SPACE bar.</desc>

        <desc>This arcade game arms you with a knife and sends you on a kamikaze mission against hordes of enemy fighters.

There are four distinct sections of gameplay, taking in a Missile Base, a Harbour, a Bridge, and an enemy Prison Camp. Extra weapons with limited ammunition can be collected along the way, which will make the task a lot easier. The level is divided into 3 horizontal levels, which can be moved between either by jumping or using ladders, and this gives a chance to avoid the more threatening mobs of enemy fighters.</desc>

        <desc>Gridtrap is a single screen game where you have to move around a grid of squares to get to bombs to defuse them before a timer reaches zero for each bomb. As you move, any square you move from disappears so careful planning of a route to a bomb needs to be taken into consideration. A boot will also move around the screen that needs avoiding and skulls cannot be landed on but flags can be collected for bonus points.

Rows of squares can be moved to make paths if there are no more squares to move on but skulls and flags cannot be moved off screen. If you move off the edge of the screen then you appear on the other side.</desc>

        <desc>In a galaxy far, far away, scientists discovered a new planet called Zilok-eti. The planet was unusual, for it was covered with strong grid-like energy fields. As your ship touched down on the planet surface, you discovered also different kinds of energon cubes, that could help you to escape from the forces of the grid. Unfortunately cybernetic war machines guard the energy cubes, and will try to to blast you into smithereens. And so the grid wars begin!</desc>

        <name>Griel's Quest for the Sangraal (HB)</name>
        <desc>Griel's Quest for the Sangraal is an MSX1 remake of the old MSX2 puzzle game, Griel no Seihai by Momonoki House, first published in Peach Up magazine 1990.

The gameplay is similar both to Soukoban and the Lolo games, though the focus is not on moving boxes around. Instead, you are a knight who must pick up magic objects to vanquish evil creatures. The following objects can be found:
Magical Staff â€“ Vanquishes RPG slimes.
Holy Cross â€“ Vanquishes ghosts.
Sacred Sword â€“ Kills ogres.
Only one magical object may be carried at any one time, and it cannot be dropped. The only way to get rid of an object is to use it against an enemy. Just as in the aforementioned puzzle games, the emphasis is therefore on picking up objects in the right order. This can get very tricky not only if a monster is in front of a desirable object, but also if it is behind an object which you can't pick up or can't use against any enemy within your reach. To complicate matters, many levels contain tiles which only allow movement in one direction, so that one can easily get stuck and must forfeit. Luckily, the monsters are immobile, so that at least timing is not a variable in the quest for the Sangraal. To aid you in your quest, you are given a password every five levels.

This adaptation was made for the MSXdev '05 coding contest.</desc>

        <desc>Guardic is a top-down 2d shooter based on the classic premise of pitting a single starfighter against a horde of enemies with the fate of the galaxy at hand. A particularly interesting touch in Guardic is that instead of fighting through a scrolling field filled with enemies, the game places your ship in &amp;quot;rooms&amp;quot; with a fixed amount of opponents that take up the most part of the screen. After defeating every enemy on screen you advance to the next room and so on... Power ups are not activated until you reach the next room (with some exceptions) and even then you have to choose which ones to activate before you enter the fight, which gives the game an additional strategic touch.</desc>

        <desc>Deviating slightly from Compile's usual vertically scrolling fashion, Gulkave is a rather orthodox horizontal shooter. Flying across ? or inside ? a parallax scrolling landscape, your spaceship must singlehandedly take out eight fortresses. In your way stand enemy spaceships that either try to crush you or fire at you, as well as some asteroids thrown in for good measure. For each hit you take, your ship is not destroyed. Instead, you have a power (barrier) bar that decreases gradually until you finally lose a ship. At the end of each level, bonus points are given according to your remaining barrier. Losing a ship means you lose all your weapons upgrades as well. As usual with a shooter from this maker, the powerups come in the shape of numbered pods that are released from Zanac-style blocks. Different upgrades give higher shot counts, more simultaneous bullets or bigger energy waves. At certain score intervals, you're granted bonus ships.

The game was released for both the MSX and Sega's SG-1000 console, the latter version having two levels less.</desc>

Once the wanted criminal is encountered, the game again switches to a first person cross hair view, where the first to draw will be the winner. Taking out the criminal will give you a reward that helps you with future expenditures as the cost of ammo and horses changes as the game goes along.

        <desc>The entire solar system is being attacked by the vicious Gyrusians, and it's up to you to save the day! You will need to fly your spaceship to each of the nine planets and then clear three stages of enemies to rid that planet of the Gyrusians. You start the game with a single cannon, but can gain a double cannon after shooting a power up satellite. After clearing each planet, there is another bonus stage where additional weapons and bonus points can be collected. Gyruss is an arcade action shooter, however instead of piloting your spaceship horizontally or vertically, you move in a circle around the perimeter of the screen.

On your MSX in a cartridge with original SN76489 sound chip, for a game with 6 sound channels. Enhanced version of the Original Coleco game.</desc>

        <desc>There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!). If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</desc>

Players can compete in stroke play with up to four players, or match play against a friend or the computer. When playing against the computer, the player will play against an opponent that uses metal clubs, which hit farther than the standard wooden clubs.

In addition to stroke and match play, players can obtain passwords that allow a replay of any spectacular shots that are made (eagles, holes-in-one, and double-eagles).</desc>

        <desc>Humphrey is a spry chap who needs to change the color of all the blocks. What should be a simple task is made difficult by atomic bombs that drop from block to block so get hopping Humphrey.

Humphrey is a Q*Bert variant. Like in Q*Bert, Humphrey hops from block to block, changing the color of any block he lands on. When all the block's colors are changed, he moves to the next level. Making life difficult are atomic bombs that start at the top and bounce down the board. When they drop off the bottom, they reappear at the top. If Humphrey hits or is hit by an atomic bomb, he loses a life and the current level resets to the beginning. When all lives are gone, the game is over. Unlike Q*Bert, enemies only move down, not up. As the game progresses, there will be more bombs and they will have more bounces.</desc>

        <desc>You are Chumy, the mouse. You live in the sewer, and you are hungry. Luckily, the sewer is filled with cheese, only it is guarded by menacing creatures such as rabbits, turtles and bats.

In order to get his cheese, Chumy must go between platforms connected by ladders, all the time avoiding the other creatures. Luckily, Chumy can jump very far, across and above the nasties. Chumy also has an arsenal of cans to throw at the enemies. Most die after just one hit, whereas others are more impervious to attacks. The rabbits are particularly dangerous, since they may pounce at you unexpectedly, they being able to jump just as far as Chumy. When Chumy eats cheese (or bombs or biscuits), he moves slower due to the extra weight. When the mouse has fed on all the cheese, it can take the dust chute down from the top level to the bottom, and make its way to the exit and on to the next level. Control Chumy with the cursor keys and X for jumping, C for throwing.

This game has also been included, in a slightly revised form, on Compile's Disk Station #0.</desc>

        <desc>An evil demon named Varalys casts a curse upon the princess Ann, turning her into three fairies. You control Sir Jim and set out to find the fairies, and then slay Varalys.  Only by vanquishing Varalys can the curse be lifted. Once the princess is restored the kingdom will be saved.

Hydlide is an action game with strong role-playing elements. The player has to explore vast wilderness areas, descending into dungeons and eliminating enemies on the way. Combat system is similar to the one implemented in Ys series: attacking enemies requires the player to &amp;quot;bump&amp;quot; into them, at the same time preventing them from attacking the playable character from the sides and the back. The player can change between defensive and offensive stances by pressing a single button. Magic spells can also be used to dispose of the enemies. The player character grows stronger and gains better parameters as he advances in the game.</desc>

        <desc>The third entry in the Hydlide series, continuing its action RPG legacy. Character creation allows the player to choose one of the four character classes: Warrior, Thief, Priest, and Monk. In combat, the protagonist uses melee or long-ranged weapons or casts magic spells. Unlike the previous games in the series, the player is required to press the attack button during melee combat, instead of simply "bumping" into the enemies. There is an internal clock in the game, which makes it necessary for the protagonist to sleep periodically and regain his strength. The main character also has to eat from time to time, otherwise his hit points will gradually decrease. The morality system from the previous game returns: killing friendly creatures will reduce the player's morality level, which will eventually have an effect on one of the game's most decisive battles.</desc>

        <desc>Hydlide II: Shine Of Darkness is an action RPG, and the second installment in the Hydlide series.

In a different space a wonderful world existed, called Fairy Land, which was dominated by swords and magic after the times of domination by monsters and evil had ended. The people of Fairy Land were intoxicated with peace. At that time an incident occurred. A Consciousness filled with evil awoke and it created new monsters, brought the dead back to life, and wanted to dominate Fairy Land again.

The monks were one of the first who noticed this and warned the people about it but they didn't listen and left the monks disappointed. The monks prayed to God and asked Him if there was a Savior. God, impressed by the monks prayers warped the space-time of Fairy Land with the human world and selected an innocent boy who lived there.

The player controls the innocent boy, who must roam the lands of Fairy Land and free it from evil. The player has to create a character before beginning the quest, customizing his parameters - life, strength, and magic. As in the previous game, the player slays enemies by "bumping" into them or using magical spells. It is possible to change between attacking and defensive stances on the fly. The hero can become stronger and gain additional powers. In the villages there are shops where the protagonist can buy and sell weapons, armor, and items.</desc>

The MSX version replaces the hurdles with a 400 meter dash.

The Famicom version loses the hammer throw and the high jump, but the NES version restores the high jump while adding skeet shooting, the triple jump and archery as events. The NES version also keeps the 110 meter hurdles and forgoes the 400 meter dash.

If the player wants to go to the next event or round then they will have to qualify, by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum distances. This game contains a two player option, in which the players take it in turns.</desc>

        <desc>The greatest athletes from around the world have gathered for the grandest sporting spectacle since the golden age of Greece. This pressure-packed competition is as fierce as a starved lion. Surviving is a matter of sweat and concentration in Taekwondo, pole vaulting, canoeing, skeet shooting, hammer throwing, high diving, archery, hurdles, gymnastics, hang gliding, pistol firing, arm wrestling, fencing, triple jumping and swimming... Whew! Wears you out just to read them all. The odds in Vegas say you don't have enough strength, stamina or skill, but you know better. And as long as you win, you're the crowd favorite. But lose, and you might as well turn in your jockstrap and joystick.</desc>

        <desc>Six tough events await in this joystick-waggling successor to Track &amp;Field.

The full sequence of events is - swimming, skeet shooting, gymnastics, archery, triple jumping and weightlifting. You must complete each event in order to be allowed onto the next one.

Swimming involves moving left and right as fast as possible, while pressing fire when a breath is required. Skeet shooting and archery both come down to timing - though elevation and wind factors affect the latter. Gymnastics involves timing a succession of presses to ensure that the jump is long and the landing graceful. The triple jump involves one press for each part of the jump, whereas the weightlifting involves merely brute strength.

If the player wants to go to the next event or round, they will have to qualify by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum targets.</desc>

        <desc>Hyper Viper is a Snake game. The player controlled snake has to eat all the mushrooms that are found around the screen. As more mushrooms are eaten the snake grows longer. The screen is also full of rocks and these need to be avoided. Colliding with a rock, the walls or the snake's body leads to a lost life. Some mushrooms are flashing which means that they are about to be transformed into a rock. After eating a flashing mushroom the snake is able to eat one rock. Once all mushrooms have been eaten the player moves on to the next level. Later levels have more advanced layout with more walls to collide with. There are five levels in total.</desc>

        <desc>Strategy games with a real-time movement element didn't begin with Dune 2, and this was one early implementation of the concept. Your army has landed on an alien planet and has the intention of destroying their weather control station, and ideally as many of their units as possible.

The action is viewed from above, and you use a cursor to direct units, and automatically target and attack enemy units. Once you blow up the weather control tower, by exploding at least 2 bombs next to it, you must flee the planet ASAP. Protecting all your units is important and requires a tactical overview approach, but the bombs are particularly vital.</desc>

After an amazing day, in which their institute club has obtained for the fourth time in a row the Science Olympiad 1st award, the happy couple can at least relax in the city cliff, looking at a great star-filled night sky. But the happiness will not last as much as they expected?

Suddenly, a thunderbolt felt from the sky and hit Ned's car. When Ned managed to react, he saw a horrible image: a huge evil shadow had fallen over the city and kidnapped Linda. With an evil laugh, the demonic entity slipped through the windows of the school, taking his girlfriend inside and plunging the city into chaos and darkness. Ned, still stunned by the lightning strike, believed that the end was near for all?

But when the evil forces rise over the good ones, the moon cast its spell on the hero, the chosen one, the one designed to save us all. And the moon threw its power beam on Ned, he felt strange and full of power again! Now, with his new powers, he will start his quest to save to save his girlfriend and destroy the Evil One. Are you brave enough to face your destiny?</desc>

        <name>Jack the Nipper (Euro)</name>
        <desc>Jack the Nipper is a platform game that contains 50 screens packed with action.

Jack is an evil and wicked toddler. You play Jack and you have to cause as much trouble without being penalized for it. To see how naughty you've been there is a naughtyometer at the bottom of the screen.

To cause some mayhem Jack must jump on things, pick up objects and drop those at places where they cause the most trouble to grown-ups.

The various objects can be found all over town and at Jack's home.
The game starts at Jack's home but Jack can walk out the door and go into town to, for example, blow up the police station, kill all flowers or free prisoners. Try to get a credit card and do some serious shopping!

The first thing you should look for is you peashooter and fire peas at various objects or persons. Toot your horn to frustrate grown-ups or animals.

The naughtier your the higher your naughtyometer goes up!
The game comes to an end as the naughtyometer reaches 100%.
Cause as much trouble as you can... but don't get spanked for it by grown-ups!</desc>

        <name>Jack the Nipper II - In Coconut Capers (Euro)</name>
        <desc>Naughty toddler Jack finds himself in Africa, with the aim of progressing through 192 screens of platform action. He starts with nine lives but no weapons, although a supply of coconuts to lob is close at hand. 

The jungle is full of snakes, rhinos, birds and all manner of other creatures, all of which must be avoided or killed - remember that their attack paths are pre-programmed, and the trajectory of your coconuts is quite limited. Travelling through the levels involves, amongst other things, ladders, mine carts, trees, ropes and logs.

As well as simply completing the game and amassing as many points as possible, you can aim to be as naughty as possible, which is gauged by a 'Naughty-O-Meter' next to the score, with numerous objects available for that purpose (one can be carried at a time, alongside one weapon).</desc>

        <name>Jackie Chan in Project A (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>Jackie Chan no Project A is a side-scrolling beat-em-up based on the 1983 Jackie Chan kung-fu film of the same name. At the start of each level, the protagonist has just rowed a boat to the entrance of a pirate's lair. The goal is to enter the cave and defeat the pirate leader. The entrance to the cave is infested with bats. Further inside the cavern are some red henchmen before the final confrontation with the blue pirate king. The hero has a number of special moves such as punch, forwards and backwards kicks, flying kick and a downwards punch to enemies that have been floored. Fighting involves repeatedly hitting your opponent until they fall down, and then delivering a special knockout blow. Each move drains the player's energy, as does being hit by your opponents. At other times, energy is constantly replenished. Running out of energy causes the loss of one of your three lives, and loss of all lives ends the game.</desc>

Joe Blade is viewed side-on and uses flick-screen progression. The bombs are deactivated by arranging letters into alphabetical order, but the bulk of the gameplay involves shooting and maze navigation. The screens are linked in various ways, and contain a number of keys which must be used correctly. </desc>

        <desc>This arcade game is a cross between Breakout and Space Invaders. Player controls an electromechanical robot, who walks along the top of a wall consisting of bricks and jumps on it. A line of bugs is coming to him from the bottom of the screen in vertical direction, while the bomb is flying in horizontal direction in the center. Bugs may be killed by jumping on the wall, which results in a brick falling from its bottom. The number of jumps is equal to the bottom brick's distance from the robot. Flying bomb may eliminate the brick until it reaches the bug, but if the bug is killed, its bad or good soul will fly to the top, where robot may collect it and make influence on his mood. After the bug is eliminated, another one will start to crawl from the bottom. There is a snail moving in horizontal direction at the very bottom of the screen, which is mostly covered by the bugs crawling to the top, and it may be hit by brick in case of success also. 

The player is transferred to another level after necessary quantity of the bugs is killed. But beware! Robot's energy is exhausted, when bug is crawling upon him, and the robot becomes non-functional if the bugs reached the very top of the screen or if the robot falls off the wall.</desc>

        <desc>You play Kage, a skillful ninja in search of rescuing Princess Kiri from the hands of the warlord Yoshi. Armed only with a sword and 'star knives', you must fight your way through countless henchmen and the occasional boss to complete your task. Levels include the forest, moat, inside and outside of the castle. These levels repeat as the seasons change. The gameplay is side scrolling. Kage's moves include the ability jump extremely high in the air, grab and climb trees, block and attack with his sword, and throw shuriken. The game can be challenging at times though because the player dies in one hit. 2-players are supported, but must take turns.(Moby Game)</desc>

        <desc>The notorious thief Harry Hooligan is on the loose! You play the part of Officer Keystone Kelly, sent in to capture Harry. Harry is trapped in a four story mall, and is running as fast as he can to reach the exit at the top. Your job is to catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit. As the levels progress, Harry will run faster and faster, and more objects will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.</desc>

        <desc>King's Knight is a fantasy-themed top-down shooter where four heroes have to unite to defeat a dragon and rescue a princess in despair. It was one of the first games published by Square Soft (now one-half of Square Enix). King's Knight is a variation on Konami's Knightmare which sold extremely well.

The first four stages involve you powering up your characters as far as they can go, picking up shields (to increase defense), boots (to increase speed), swords (to increase attack power), and spell icons (which will be required to be held by everyone for the final storm on the castle), defeating monsters along the way. The power-ups are hidden underneath mountains, rocks, and houses. Nearly everything can be shot at and destroyed. The heroes are, in order:

Ray Jack, the Knight, who possesses strong attacking power; Kaliva, the Wizard, who is good with magic and jumping; Barusa, the Monster, who has a strong defense; and Toby, the Thief, who can move swiftly.

It is necessary to keep all four heroes alive for the fifth and final stage, because there are certain points that the group cannot get past if one of the party members has died.</desc>

        <desc>Our hero must reach Melkhior, a somewhat eccentric wizard who is the only one who can save him. As with most Ultimate titles of the day, reaching him is a long and treacherous challenge, involving both puzzle-solving and action, meaning that each screen requires thorough planning and precise navigation. 

The game uses the isometric viewpoint in a manner similar to the later Head Over Heels, using monochrome but detailed graphics and techniques to avoid flickering sprites. The game lasts for 40 days and nights - at night your character turns into a werewolf. Ultimate's individual style of eschewing straightforward instructions in favor of feature lists and riddles is put to good use here, with the story detailed in a rhyming poem of sorts.</desc>

        <desc>Knightmare 2:Maze of Galious/Majou Densetsu 2:Daimashikyou Galious is a 
Japanese game which was released back in 1987 for MSX. It is a sequel to Knightmare. I've never played Knightmare 1 before. All I know is that it is a shooter type of game in which you play as 
Popolon who tried to rescue his wife Aphrodite from a villain named Hudnos. The
sequel takes place right after you rescued Aphrodite.  Now you play as both 
Popolon and Aphrodite, who will try to to rescue their future baby kidnapped 
by a dark priest named Galious. The gameplay is a mix between action and RPG.
You have the side-scrolling actions throughout six worlds and yet at the same
time there are some RPG elements included such as having to find certain items
to complete certain tasks. Maze of Galious stays true to its name with its huge
and sometimes confusing maze-like worlds to be explored.Majou Densetsu II: Daimashikyou Galious is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 1987.</desc>

        <desc>In this game, you play the role of a Japanese high-school student, the leader of computer club. Above all, you like playing games. One day, you and your girlfriend are playing a game and suddenly get teleported into the game world. This is a fantasy world that resembles ancient Greek civilization. Before long you realize that you are in fact a hero who must save this world from the evil Gog, an ancient demon awaiting resurrection, otherwise you won't ever be able to return home.

Shalom is the third entry in Konami's Knightmare series. Unlike the previous games, it is much less heavy on action and is structured primarily like an adventure game with emphasis on interaction with characters and exploration. You navigate your hero through a large top-down world, interacting with characters along the way. The interaction is done via a command menu with verbs such as "Look", "Talk", "Take", etc. From time to time you'll have to fight enemies. The battles take place on a separate screen, and you attack the enemy with your weapons in real time.</desc>

A rain of blows can produce a quick knockout, but in general you must hit him many times, and then with a knockout blow, to see him go down. There is a referee. The game has a two player option.

To win each match you must get to 10 points with a 2 point lead - if the scores reach 10-9 the game goes on until someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in a similar manner to tennis. There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin.</desc>

        <desc>Arkanoid-style Breakout clone, which unlike most other similar games has the bat on the side of the screen (there is a left/right option) instead of at the bottom.  There are 100 screens to be conquered.

There are a number of types of special bricks, but unlike e.g. Arkanoid, they do not fall towards the bat. Instead, when you hit a special brick, it flips to show a letter. E.g. E (Extend bat), C (Catch ball), M (Missile), B (Bomb, explodes when hit by ball, clearing a number of bricks) and X (Extra life).  Extra lives are also awarded when the player scores 10,000 points.

The enemies/obstacles are more varied than in Arkanoid. Some make the bat freeze, some actually chew and eat your ball and spit out the core back at you!</desc>

        <desc>Loosely based on a movie, Kung-Fu Master is a side scrolling action game for one or two players, who alternate turns.

Mr. X has captured the pickpocket Sylvia and it is up to Thomas, a kung-fu master who owns a restaurant, to get her back. She is located on the top floor of Mr. X's castle and Thomas will need to fight his way to the top. Of course, this won't be easy as each floor has many opponents to get past and a floor boss at the end of each level. 

Thomas is able to move left and right, jump, duck, and punch and kick. Enemy projectiles such as knives can be kicked in the air to rebound them towards the enemy. On the top floor resides Mr. X himself. </desc>

You can move around from floor to floor, and go into the back rooms and play the old (and I mean old) computer games that are in these rooms. Be careful you wouldn't want to get caught by security guards that are roaming the floors. There are 18 rooms to choose from, there are 3 that actually aren't games, and of course everyones favorite, the one that isn't a classic game, but you are just trying to get drinks off of the bartender, while avoiding the drunk.</desc>

        <desc>Once there was only one continent in the world. It was populated by magicians. At first they lived in peace, using magic to make the land prosper. But soon they were divided into two groups: good and evil. The forces of vice were strong, and the benevolent magicians need the help of a lone warrior to venture into the castle of the evil magicians and defeat them.

Legendly Knight is a Korean-made action game with platforming elements. The game consists of single-screen stages, most of which contain platform structures. The player-controlled knight can jump and attack enemies. The goal is to kill all the enemies on the screen, including bosses which are fought one-on-one.

The knight has a health bar measured by hearts. He is armed with a small sword in the beginning, but later can find throwing weapons and magic spells. Items include armor, a scuba suit, health-restoring potions, and a ring that grants temporary invincibility. Keys must be obtained in order to access the boss room. All these items are invisible, and their exact location must be revealed by attacking spots in the stage. It is possible to find and equip glasses that would show the exact location of the keys.</desc>

        <name>Life in the Fast Lane (Euro)</name>
        <desc>Life in the Fast Lane can best be described as a cross between Trailblazer, for its bouncy ball on a chequered path action, and Elektraglide for its twisty road and futuristic enemies and obstacles.

Your task is simple: Travel as far as you can on the road inside your rolling sphere. There are obstacles in the road that you must avoid, either by going to the left or right or by jumping over them. Unlike Trailblazer, you can jump a whole lot, even to the point of virtually flying above the level. Not even then are you safe, though, since airplanes will attack you in the sky.

The ground has holes in it. If you miscalculate a leap, and fall into a black hole, you are dropped into something very much like Tempest, with your sphere moving across the outer edge of a space tunnel, shooting at the things that come out of it. If you fall into a water-filled hole, you fall through the road and find that it runs above a river. Here, you are attacked by fish, but luckily you can shoot back at them (something you cannot do on the ground). The next time there is a whole in the ground, you have a chance to resurface. All the while, you must make sure not to expend your jumping and shooting power bars, or you will be left vulnerable.(Moby Games)</desc>

The name of the game indicates a tour around each of the searches of David Livingstone that carry out the journalist Henry Morton Stanley in Africa in the 19th century. There the resemblance to reality ends and turns into a platform game.</desc>

        <desc>This is the sequel to Livingstone Supongo. It means that Dr. Livingstone will return to our screens to be rescued definitively. In this game you must pass 2 worlds, filled of dangerous savage animals, unfriendly natives, a lot of mortal traps, and, of course, risk and adventure in pure state.

Livingstone Supongo 2 starts where you finalized the first game, and that as I said before, you must surpass the 2 levels to find the place where Dr. Livingstone is prisoner. In this sequel you must take some important objects to pass to next level.</desc>

        <desc>The Bungeling Empire has stolen a huge cache of gold from its rightful owners, and your mission is to infiltrate its treasury and recapture it. This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes.

The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.

This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.</desc>

        <desc>Another arcade classic finds a new form in 3D! And this time it's Lode Runner...

Lode Runner 2 is the sequel to the remake of Doug Smith's timeless classic. The game features 5 unique worlds where in each level you will try to collect all the gold without dying. Run, dig, climb, scale, fall, drob bombs and collect stuff! 

Like in Jazz Jackrabbit 2, this sequel has also added a companion (Jane) to its main character (Jake Peril). They are identical in their capabilities --no special moves. Choose one of them and get into Lode Runner's new dimension!

        <desc>Lot Lot is a puzzle game. The goal of the game is of extreme simplicity. Manipulate the balls in such a way till they fall into the pits and generate points.

The game has five pits: Out, 0 points, 10 points, 30 points and 50 points.

Each level starts by giving the player a target score that has to be reached before the player can continue on to the next level.

The screen is divided into sixteen sections. The walls of those sections randomly disappear and the balls will then drop or roll into the other section or a pit at the bottom of the screen.

On the screen, there will be two arrows of which the second arrow follows the first one, but with a slight delay, and it stops at the same position as the first one.

The arrows will start in an empty section of which one of the walls will soon disappear. To move the balls to the empty section move the first arrow to a section that is filled with balls end press the space bar or fire button. The balls will then be moved to the empty section. If both sections contain balls then the balls will be swapped accordingly.

Now the goal is to manipulate the balls in such a way that they will  fall into the pits, thus generating points for the player.

In the bottom left of the screen there is a section that has a thin red line at the bottom. Never move the balls in that section because if any balls enter that section a crab will appear and cut the red line with its razor sharp claws, causing the balls to disappear in the pit labeled 'OUT' and resulting in the player losing a life.</desc>

        <desc>Malaika will find different scenarios where she must defeat every enemy around. When every foe is finished, you will be able to proceed.

Malaika's attack is based on the bone in her hair: she can shoot it to a certain distance so she can stun enemies. Once they are stunned, you can run over them in order to kill 'em. But be sure not to touch them when they are awake and kickin'!

There are lots of hidden items at every scenario. Try to find where they are located, as they are pretty useful! Most of them gives you points, but some of them can feature certain effects.</desc>

        <desc>Malaika must chase the enemies to discover their secret and to have her town-people back again into their human aspect. She must travel through lots of different worlds fighting monsters and collecting jewels and items in order to succeed. Each world has four different stages and the boss that hides at the end of the fourth one.

You, as Malaika, will start every stage from the left, and you must proceed all the way to the right to complete each stage. The stage will be completed once you cross the magical door. In your way you'll face lots of monsters and obstacles that will try to trash your mission away, and you'll find items that will help you in your quest.

You must reach the final stage and fight the Alien Slime King for the last time in order to beat the game and finish your mission.</desc>

        <desc>Maze Max is a racing game similar to the arcade game Rally-X. Like in the arcade game the players is in control of a racing car and has to drive it through a maze in search for flags. There are ten flags in the maze and they all have to be collected in order to complete the level. At the same time it is necessary to watch out for the AI controlled cars that are pursuing and trying to crash into the player's car. In addition to flags there are fuel tanks that have to be collected to avoid running out of gas. Crashing with a chasing car or running out of fuel leads to a life being lost and the player has three at the start. After a level has been completed the player moves on to the next which has one additional chasing car. The main difference from Rally-X is that it is not possible to use smoke screens to distract the cars. </desc>

        <desc>Hi, my name is Philip Sunset, but my friends call me &amp;quot;long hands&amp;quot; and my office is one of the best remunerated of the galaxy, I am an illegal appropriator of objects that I do not own, although there are people who vulgarly call it &amp;quot;thief&amp;quot;. And this time I am involved in a very undesirable situation. The thing is that I took the Sprocket System &amp;quot;landed&amp;quot;, apparently one of the most secret treasures of the Drowhar army. But, as usual, these boys are not very happy and have decided to convert me into cosmic phosphate, something that wouldn't be so easy for them. I was contracted as a pilot by the Terra-1 confederation interstellar forces, although it wouldn't be bad at all if you could help me...</desc>

        <desc>Mega Phoenix brings the concept of the earlier arcade game Phoenix into the 90s, to the extent that a coin-op version was later made by Gaelco. The game is a single-screen shoot â€˜em up in which the player moves left to right while shooting several waves. There is a shield function available, which lasts for a short period of time (after which it must recharge to be used again) and it paralyses the craft while active.

The first waves consist of several small alien beings in a set pattern, which move down from the fleet towards the player at random intervals- contacts with these kills the player. Deadly phoenixes firing at you come next, followed by the Mega Phoenix itself and then a final boss, before it all repeats with higher difficulty.</desc>

        <desc>The Eggerland series consists of several puzzle games. This game is a sequel to Eggerland Mystery. Again you play Lolo, a blue ball-like character with eyes, arms, and legs. The story mainly deals with King Egger, the villain, who has captured princess Lala, who is similar to Lolo, only she is red. Again it's up to Lolo to rescue Lala by travelling through Egger's domain and solving the puzzle rooms laid out before him. You must guide Lolo through a room of tiles and collect all of the Heart Framers in the room. Doing this opens up a Jewel Box, which contains an item. Successfully acquiring the contents of the Jewel Box will clear the room of all monsters and open the way to the next room(s). All the rooms are connected but not all the room entrances or exits are closed.
To fight the monsters Lolo has a weapon: the Magic Shot. Two shots can be obtained by collecting certain Heart Framers. There are numerous types of obstacles in the rooms. Emerald Framers are green blocks that Lolo may push around freely. To make it all more challenging there are also numerous terrain obstacles, like water, sand and grass which have all different drawbacks for Lolo.</desc>

At the beginning of each round the labyrinth floor is shortly visible, giving you the opportunity to locate the keys and the vault in the labyrinth. After a few seconds the labyrinth turns black. Only your direct surroundings of the labyrinth lightened.

Now it becomes your goal to collect all the keys, open the vault with the collected keys and then return to the middle of the labyrinth to enter the door and go to the next floor.

There are at least three hostile green men running around in the labyrinth who are trying to catch you. You'll loose a life when they catch you.</desc>

In The Secret Treasure Of Moai your goal is to reach the level exit at the top by climbing and destroying the rock structures before you run out of time or got caught by enemies.

The rocks can be destroyed with the hammer that you carry. When destroying rock formations you might find special items and you should collect these or otherwise you might end up being unable to reach the level exit. You also won't reach the end of the level if you destroy the wrong rock structures or destroy them in the wrong order. As you progress in the game the puzzles to reach the exit become more challenging.

The game contains bonus stages in which you have to collect as much diamonds as you can within the time limit. (Moby Games)</desc>

        <name>Mole Mole (Bra)</name>
        <desc>Mole Mole is a puzzle game in which the player has to navigate a rather anthropomorphic mole through side-view single-screen stages, with the goal of reaching the exit after having collected all the fruits on the screen.

The mole can climb the stairs scattered around the levels, or dig tunnels in any direction except upwards. All the levels also include boulders, which will fall down if disturbed by the mole's burrowing activities. As opposed to  Boulder Dash variants, the boulders cannot kill the mole or harm him in any way; it is impossible to &amp;quot;die&amp;quot; in the game. However, unless the player calculates the moves with extreme precision, getting irrevocably stuck and restarting the level is a common occurrence.

The player can start from any of the 45 levels, arranged in order of ascending difficulty. There is also an editor that allows the players to create their own levels.</desc>

        <desc>The follow-up to Mole Mole plays exactly like the original, which means that it is very close to Boulder Dash but at a slower pace, since each move requires planning, whereas falling boulders won't kill you. Three difficulty levels are on offer: Selections, Children and Experts. Your mole, while digging tunnels in the earth to collect each and every item on-screen before proceeding to the exit, can neither jump nor dig upwards, which is what makes careful planning of your tunnels necessary. To your aid, you have a map screen which shows the entire level in a zoomed-out format. The same screen is also used for the built-in level editor.</desc>

        <desc>This platform game is about solving arithmetic problems. In the equation one number is missing, you 'll have to find the right number. This game is aimed at young children to help them learn arithmetic problem solving or playing with numbers.

Some monkeys are minding their own business when they see a number missing from their arithmetic problem. Who took it? Another monkey, a crab? And where could it be? The only way to find that out is to go looking for it.

Guide your monkey across the screen and up and down platform levels. Watch out for the crab! If its claws bite you, you lose a monkey. Jump up and pull down shades to find the missing number. When you find it, catch the number bar. Then send it up to your helper monkey. Find three missing numbers and earn bonus points!</desc>

        <desc>Montana John, a brave adventurer without fear has inherited a diary from his late uncle about the greatest treasure known to mankind: the treasure of the Templars.

The Templars were a famous Christian military order in the Middle Ages. Their task was to grant Christians safety on their pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The organization of the Templars grew rapidly in membership, power and wealth. The Templars started banks worldwide and invented the world's first credit card!

Montana John sets out on a journey to the Templar's temples located in a dark forest. During his adventure, supernatural forces and creepy animals try their best to prevent Montana to get to the treasure chamber. If that wasn't enough already, the temples feature fiendish puzzles. Will Montana make it to the treasure room alive..?</desc>

        <desc>Moon Patrol is a side-scrolling game where the player must drive a moon buggy from one station on the Moon to another, all while avoiding crashing or getting destroyed by alien ships. The vehicle is constantly moving right and the player can speed up or slow down, jump, and shoot (simultaneously firing upwards and forwards.) There are 25 checkpoints along the way, each symbolized with a letter from A to Z, and serving as a respawn point. Every five checkpoints mark a separate &amp;quot;stage&amp;quot; within the entire course; reaching the end of a stage under the par time grants a large score bonus. 

Dangers on the Moon include rocks (small and big ones) which can be shot to pieces or jumped over, pits which must be jumped, and UFO's which fire at the player or bombard the ground (creating pits). Later the player also comes upon stationary tanks which fire missiles (that can be destroyed with the player's own shots), landmines, carnivorous plants that pop up out of pits, and rocket cars which stalk the buggy from behind before rushing forward in an attempt to ram it down. 

After completing the first course (the &amp;quot;Beginner Course&amp;quot;) the player can try his skill on the harder Champion Course. </desc>

You begin your mission in space where you must avoid deadly aurora flares, photon torches and space bullets from the sun in this quadrant. From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).</desc>

        <name>Mortadelo y Filemon (Spanish)</name>
        <desc>Mortadelo y Filemon is an action game with puzzle elements, based on the Spanish comic book series of the same name. The two protagonists are special agents and in this game they need to find Dr. Bakterius who was kidnapped by the competing agency OMA.

The main part of the game takes place on the city map which is shown from a top-down perspective (except persons, cars and trees). Here the protagonists need to explore the city and its sewers to find hints on Bakterius' location. However, there are many locations where Clever &amp; Smart need to have certain items in their possession to proceed. For example to enter some houses Clever needs to use one of his trademark disguises or in the sewer they can tap telephone phone line with the right tools.

Another important resource is money which is used to buy items, disguises and food. The latter is essential for survival because a hunger value constantly rises when the heroes don't eat. Money is either earned by illegal activities like burglary or forging checks or by playing mini games like flipping coins or a snail race (Clever participating himself in disguise).</desc>

        <desc>The famous crazy-scientist Dr. Bacterio was experimenting with hens to let them grow to the size of a horse, thus trying definitively to end the hunger in the world. But, as was habitual in his experiments, he had failed in his objective and now a gang of uncontrolled hens is circulating around the city putting eggs on the street. But certain special eggs have the capacity to turn one person into a hen (or at least that's what they believed) if the egg crushes on his head.

Is the sequel of the first game dedicated to the famous IbaÃ±ez's comicbook saga, "Mortadelo y FilemÃ³n", known as "Clever &amp; Smart" or "Flip &amp; Flop" outside Spain.</desc>

        <name>Mr. Do! vs Unicorns (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>Mr. Do! vs Unicorns (AKA Mr. Do!'s Castle) is an action platform game which has you in a castle consisting of several floors, each of which contain a variety of blocks. You control Mr. Do! the clown who has a hammer which can be used to knock out the blocks in the floor. Wandering throughout the castle are deadly unicorns which are constantly trying to catch you. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible and to progress through the increasingly difficult castles.

There are two ways to complete a castle; you can either destroy all of the deadly unicorns by crushing them with blocks, or you can knock out all of the blocks which have a cherry symbol on them. In addition to the cherry blocks, there are three blocks with a key. If all three key blocks are knocked out, the door on the roof of the castle unlocks. If you make it to the door, all of the unicorns will temporarily become harmless and will contain a letter. If you hit a letter unicorn, you will earn a letter in the word EXTRA. Spell the complete word, and you will earn an extra life.

The last type of block you'll encounter has a skull on it. If you knock out two skull blocks, all of the blocks between them will also be knocked out and replaced with a bridge. As the castles progress, the castle layout will become trickier and the unicorns become faster and more numerous. (Moby Games)</desc>

        <desc>You are Monty and you are about to attempt to fulfill your life's ambitions, become rich and be a hero. You have the opportunity to rescue a Princess while collecting gold nuggets on the way. The game consists of 40 single screen rooms viewed from above at an elevated angle, and to leave each room you must collect all the gold nuggets scattered around within a time limit, and once all the gold is collected then you can leave by the opened door. Moving around each room are various creatures and if you touch any, then you lose one of five lives, and failing also to complete the room within the time limit also loses a life. The joystick is used to control Monty and once you move him in a direction he keeps moving until he hits an object but he can change direction as he moves. Also to note is that the longer you hold the joystick in a direction the faster Monty moves.</desc>

        <desc>Nemesis is the first entry in the long-running Gradius series on the Game Boy. Its side-scrolling shoot'em up gameplay follows the series template closely. Players control the Vic Viper through five levels, most based on levels in earlier entries, for a kind of 'greatest hits' of the series. There is a cave level (as in level 1 of the original Gradius), the mandatory Moai stage, a Gigeresque organic level, a graveyard (similar to bonus stages in the MSX and PC Engine version of the original Gradius) and a high-tech base. Besides the classic core ship in the first level, all boss enemies are entirely new.

The cycling Gradius power-up system is reused here: collected power ups advance the power meter which can be activated at any time to gain the highlighted item. The line-up includes the classic selection of speedups, missiles, dual shots, lasers, option satellites and forcefields.

The game allows players to start in any of the five levels and even to set the number of lives to a maximum of 99.</desc>

        <desc>In the year 6664 Dr. Venom, the director of the Space Science Agency, was exiled to the planet Sard for his involvement in a failed rebellion and illegal scientific activities. One year later, he joined forces with the Bacterion invaders, escaped Sard, and took control of the space surrounding the planet Gradius. In 6666, the local government sends Colonel James Burton on the newest hyperspace fighter known as Metalion. The goal is clear: stop Dr. Venom and the Bacterion army before they conquer the planet.

Nemesis 2 (Gradius 2 in Japan) is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up. The gameplay is for the most part similar to that of Gradius. The player-controlled ship can alternate between three main weapons: Missile, Double, and Laser. Extra weapons such as various types of lasers, napalm missiles, reflex ring, and back beam can be collected as power-ups and equipped. In addition, special power-ups can be acquired, their effects ranging from slowing down enemies to turning the Metalion into an invincible drill-like machine for a brief amount of time. Boss battles are followed by optional mini-stages, which grant the player new weapons if completed successfully.</desc>

The player-controlled ship can alternate between three main weapons: Missile, Double, and Laser. Extra weapons such as various types of lasers, napalm missiles, reflex ring, and back beam can be collected as power-ups and equipped. In addition, special power-ups can be acquired, their effects ranging from slowing down enemies to turning the Metalion into an invincible drill-like machine for a brief amount of time. Boss battles are followed by optional mini-stages, which grant the player new weapons if completed successfully.</desc>

        <desc>You control a Zubat as it collects food in the night. The goal is to collect as much food as possible before running into a noxious Koffing, the bane of flying Pokémon it seems. What makes things sticky is that as it's so dark you can't see them! You are a bat though and will be able to use echolocation. Using Supersonic you'll shoot sound waves forward that will let you see upcoming obstacles.

The game scrolls to the left allowing you to fly around the screen that is available. The D-pad allows you to move around the screen and the A/B button will activate your Supersonic attack.

The game can be accessed by scanning the long dot-code on the Pokemon-e Skyridge cards, Zubat (117/144) and Golbat (60/144). Or in Japan the Pokémon e-Card expansion 2 cards, Zubat (1/88) and Golbat (3/88).</desc>

        <desc>Between the Seas of the Seven Islands and the purple Mountains lies a valley. Time was that this area was safe and hospitable, however darkness then came - killing many of the inhabitants and warping the minds of the others. Many have gone there, none have returned - can you be the first?

Nightshade is an arcade adventure in scrolling isometric 3D (an advance on earlier Ultimate titles such as Knight Lore, which were flick-screen), with directional or rotational controls. You can take 3 hits from the various roaming monsters - turning from white to yellow to green as you take them - but a 4th costs you one of your five lives. Objects can be thrown at these foes, but only if you have any.

The map is made up of medieval-style buildings, which are visible while you are on the outside but whose roofs lift when you enter them, to ensure full visibility. There are four super-villains to destroy (a mad monk, a skeleton, a ghost, and Mr Grimreaper), and you must find the right objects to do this.(Moby Games)</desc>

        <name>Ninja Jajamaru-kun (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>In a realm of feudal Japanese folklore the eponymous Ninja Jajamaru-kun must rescue his beloved Princess Sakura from the clutches of a fiendish catfish-faced pirate. 

Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by jumping into them. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.

In each stage at the 80 seconds remaining mark Princess Sakura will, fittingly, drop a cherry blossom onto the field. This will float through the platforms and eventually slip off the bottom of the screen, unless the ninja intercepts this message from his love. Once three blossoms have been collected a bonus stage will occur. In the bonus stage the foe is the Pirate Lord on the top throwing fire down onto Jajamaru-kun below. Here shuriken can be thrown upwards. One hit kills the pirate and frees the princess. As the game progresses these bonus stages become more difficult adding clones of the wicked lord and more fire.

As the levels progress the new enemies, based on Japanese folklore, emerge. A new enemy will always appear as a &amp;quot;boss&amp;quot;. This new enemy will be the only one of its kind on the top tier and all the other spirits will be comprised of the previous boss. The boss will be more intelligent than the other minions. After a spirit has been the boss for several stages it will become the standard minion and loss some of its difficulty. A new more difficult boss will then appear for the next few levels, and so on.

Items can be found occasionally by breaking a brick ceiling, the items in any give stage are randomized.  Items once uncovered will remain until another ceiling is broken or are picked up. Items that alter the status of ninja have a transient effect.

The items in this game are:Speed-up: This red ball will increase the determined ninja's speed, now he can get behind even the most cunning kami.

Ninja-cart: This little carriage can crush anything in it's path and move at incredible speeds, find this and your victory will be assured!

Shuriken: Finding this shuriken will increase the distance your deadly ninja stars can be thrown, snipe those oni.

Invisibility Potion: A highly potent blend capable of turning this ninja, if not totally invisible, into an invincible outline.

Inscribed Coins: These coins give additional points, different colors give different point valuations.
Extra Ninja: These little ninjas are extra lives, very rare!

Bombs: These two bombs can appear when a ceiling is cracked open. If the player is careless enough to jump into them after they are revealed he will surely meet his death. Enemies may pass through bombs with impunity.

Trusty Frog: The trusty frog is Jajamaru-kun's trusty steed, by getting three different items, or by gaining four lives, the frog will appear.</desc>

The ninja has no weapons or abilities. Avoiding the guards is the only way to win, touching the enemy guard means death.(Moby Games)</desc>

Players can throw shurikens to defeat enemies. Defeated enemies leave behind scrolls which when collected increase the players score.(Moby Games)</desc>

        <desc>The game is to get to the top of a castle overrun by ninja. You start off at the bottom at the moat. You must kill 10 enemies to continue on to next level. On the way you must run backwards and forwards to kill the ninja; you can also pick up special powers which will only last a little while. Get to the top and the game repeats itself but a lot harder and even more ninja to kill.(Moby Games)</desc>

        <desc>So you want to be a Knight of the King Abdul Honeickam Gargoy, young countryman? I can see that you are accurate with the arch, fast with the sword, and tough in hand-to-hand combat... but you need to prove that you're brave enough!

My boy, you'll be locked in the Castle with no name. You've to survive the nightmare world inside... and escape alive! Others have tried without success, and were sadly transformed into ogres by the evil mage Nirlem. Good luck!

This was one of the first games by Dinamic. It's a challenging side-scrolling game with Ghosts N' Goblins style gameplay, with some strange monsters (you know, the Castle was previously owned by Alucard!) and potions that can help you a bit. By the way... you can climb ropes, and will frequently need to.</desc>

        <name>Norseman (HB)</name>
        <desc>In Norseman the player controls a Viking warrior trying to defend the magic Golden Viking Helmet.

The screen shows a courtyard divided in hexagons. The player has to protect the Golden Viking Helmet, which is at the bottom of the screen, from the attack of five different kinds of enemies. Each wave of enemies is composed of 5 of them. The enemies will appear in the top of the screen and will move toward the bottom of the screen; they can only move down (or diagonally down), and once they reach the bottom or the side of the screen they will reappear on the top or the opposite side. The Viking can move in all six directions, and will also reappear on the opposite side whenever he reaches the border. In order to attack, the Viking has to move inside the hexagon the enemy is in before the enemy moves against him first. As the enemies can only move downwards, approaching them from the 3 upper sides is advised.

When an enemy dies, the corpse remains in the hexagon, making it impossible to move through it. Well placed corpses can function as a trap for other enemies, as they can only move downwards. The player can also get trapped by surrounding corpses. Once all 5 enemies are dead, a new wave of enemies comes. Each new wave has different enemies, in the following order: giants, octopuses, dragons, skeletons and bats. Once all waves are beaten, the game restarts from the first wave in a greater difficulty, while retaining the player's score. If the player dies or the Golden Viking Helmet is stolen, the game is over.

The game has 10 variations:
Game 0: 1 helmet, monsters moving from top to bottom only.
Game 1: 2 helmets, monsters moving from top to bottom only. 
Game 2: 3 helmets, monsters moving from top to bottom only.
Game 3: Same as game 0, but this time the Viking warrior can only attack a monster when it appears in flashing, bright red.
Game 4: As game 1, but this time the Viking warrior can only attack a monster when it appears in flashing, bright red.
Game 5: As game 2, but this time the Viking warrior can only attack a monster when it appears in flashing, bright red.
Game 6: 1 helmet, monsters will come from all directions: two monsters moving from top to bottom, and one each from left to right, from right to left and from the bottom to the top. Monsters can stumble onto one single dead colleague and thus commit suicide.
Game 7: Same as game 6, but with 2 helmets.
Game 8: As game 6, but with 3 helmets.
Game 9: This variety combines all handicaps of the previous nine varieties: 3 helmets, monsters coming from all directs and the flashing red monsters.</desc>

We have to find and/or fight our way through the robotic guards gone crazy and many other strange creatures that probably got influenced by a high radiation level. The hero has a laser pistol, but the ammo is limited, so that we should shoot on special occasions only. Instead, we have to look for and use several objects, like poison bottles, floppy disks, keys etc. - carried one at a time, they can help us to overcome the many obstacles.</desc>

        <desc>Unlike the Famicom version, the home computer version of Nuts &amp; Milk is viewed from a top-down perspective and the character (Milk) can walk in four directions. As such, all platforming elements are removed from the game and the emphasis is more on puzzle-solving. The overall goal is the same - collect all fruit onscreen while avoiding baddies, and after that collect the heart to end the level. There are different types of terrain, and the enemies can only traverse blue type of terrain. Unfortunately, the protagonist leaves behind a blue trail, so the player needs to use strategy to successfully complete his task.</desc>

        <desc>You find yourself in a world where the air has become unbreathable and Sun's light barely reaches planet Earth. With your planet almost desertic, many cities began to be built in other planets of the solar system. But... in Oberon, the fourth satellite, there appeared an strange life form, which did just awake from its lethargy. The worst of all is that these new creatures have started attacking the human populations, even if they are babies!

Without wasting any more second, you decide to go to Oberon to save the few babies still alive, before they are eaten by these monsters. Once there, your mission would be to find the babies and send them to planet Earth in a safe way. For this, you will have to buy a cryogenic valve for each one of them in the ATMs of the Company, in order to provide them more safe travel. When you finish the mission, you will have to buy a ticket back to Earth.

Oberon 69 is an arcade platformer where you will have to use your pistol to kill larvae, tentacles, robots, alien queens and her eggs, with the advantage that you can make frontal or vertical shots.</desc>

Two players can play against each other, or one player against the computer.</desc>

        <desc>In the year 2108, the world of Quorn was almost destroyed by a battle between the central computers of the East and West factions. While the West faction won, its computer no longer recognised the interests of its human creators. Instead, it started the creation of a robot society, "Outroyd" and started to wage war against the human survivors of the first battle. But one of the humans, Ramon Okudaira, has decided to take a stand against the robots. Armed only with his XX-85 Armoured suit, he will try to win back Quorn in the name of humanity.

The game is played on an 8x8 overworld map showing a birds-eye view of the armoured player. The overworld is tiled with various sort of terrain such as grass and concrete, impenetrable walls, as well as traps of various sort which may zap the player with electricity, blast them with lasers or send them falling into an endless abyss. There are also squares with water, magnetic plates and aerial rails, which may only be traversed once you have found the appropriate upgrades for your armoured suit.</desc>

        <desc>Pac-Land is a side-scrolling 1-2 player game with a cartoony feel to it. Now equipped with arms, face, and legs, Pac must guide a fairy back to her home in Fairy Land, but this task will not be easy because Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue will pursue Pac-Man as he travels through Pac-Land. When he finally transports the fairy back to her home, Pac is given some magic shoes, which will help him get to his own home, where he will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss. 

There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.</desc>

        <desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghosts' eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

        <desc>Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man. You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the dots on the board in order to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-Man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now shown in isometric perspective and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision! </desc>

        <desc>Pachicom is a pachinko game simulation. Pachinko can be described as a game that is a cross between pinball and a slot machine. This game comes with two different game modes to play. Game A lets the player play until they attain a score of at least 3000. The goal is to achieve this score as fast they possibly can. Though, the game can still end prematurely by running out of balls to shoot. Game B lets the player try to get as high of a score as possible, but with an added time limit.

The game contains over 200 different board layouts to choose from. At the main menu, just choosing Game A or B will randomly assign a board for the player to play on, while choosing Select A or B will let the player select their own board of choice to play on.

The gameplay is mainly passive. Players can only adjust the shooting pressure knob which effects the speed and location of where the balls will land.(Moby Games)</desc>

        <desc>Pachinko UFO is a simulator of the popular Japanese gambling pastime of pachinko with added computerised action elements. The main screen resembles a typical pachinko unit with pins for balls to bounce on, spinners for balls to put in motion, and baskets for them to land in. The baskets open and close, and so does the big feature in the middle of the screen, an airplane or spaceship with an integrated fruit-machine like counter. When a score specified by the counters is reached, the game changes to a shooter sequence, where the pachinko balls must be used to shoot down aliens. After that, the game continues to the next table.

The control mechanism is similar to golf games, in that the longer you press the button, the more power is given to the ball ejection mechanism. This makes for an experience unlike a real pachinko machine, where the perfect power of the ejector is reached by setting a dial at the right angle, after which it can be locked at that angle. In Pachinko UFO, you must hit a perfect timing instead.

        <desc>The Skysurf Team's performance begins at 15.000 feet. The parachute opens at 2.500 feet. The Skysurfer does a free fall at about 180 Kmph and moves horizontally at about 50 mph. This descent lasts 50-70 seconds while he does rotations and aerobatic acts and feels the pressure of the wind over the board at the same time. The board slides over the ultimate wave... the sky.

But Joe is a clear-ideas man. He thinks that life is for living it as it comes and even if you smash against floor in the end, it is better to do it with style and guts. So he does not need a parachute. If he smashes several times, doing more and more positions and proving agility and reflex he will be remembered as a real macho man and will become part of history. He will be, or course, the best skysurfer ever too. Besides a new era will start with him, the behaviour study and human philosophy. You can believe it or not, but it will happen.</desc>

        <desc>The first title in the Parodius series, although it is often confused with its sequel Parodius! From Myth to Laughter. The name itself is a portmanteau of "Gradius" and "Parody" and, eponymously, the game is a parody of the Gradius series of space-based horizontally scrolling shooters. Many of the characters and enemies are derived from that famous shooter series, while other elements are extracted from other Konami titles, such as Antarctic Adventure and TwinBee. This game is of particular note in the series as being heavily infused with Japanese culture and folklore.
The gameplay is very similar to the Gradius games, with other aspects from games such as TwinBee. However, the characters are replaced with silly characters taken from either these or other Konami games as well as Japanese culture. The music is mostly taken from classical music pieces.

The player can play as either Takosuke, an octopus, the Penguin (father of Pentarou) from Antarctic Adventure and the exclusive MSX game Penguin Adventure, Goemon from the Ganbare Goemon series, the Popolon knight from the MSX game Knightmare or the Vic Viper spaceship from Gradius. The game is composed of six stages consisting of various obstacles and enemies such as penguins and bees, as well as more traditional Gradius enemies such as moai. As with Gradius, the game utilizes a similar selection-bar based power-up system.</desc>

Many of the characters and enemies are derived from that famous shooter series, while other elements are extracted from other Konami titles, such as Antarctic Adventure and TwinBee. This game is of particular note in the series as being heavily infused with Japanese culture and folklore.
The gameplay is very similar to the Gradius games, with other aspects from games such as TwinBee. However, the characters are replaced with silly characters taken from either these or other Konami games as well as Japanese culture. The music is mostly taken from classical music pieces.

The player can play as either Takosuke, an octopus, the Penguin (father of Pentarou) from Antarctic Adventure and the exclusive MSX game Penguin Adventure, Goemon from the Ganbare Goemon series, the Popolon knight from the MSX game Knightmare or the Vic Viper spaceship from Gradius. The game is composed of six stages consisting of various obstacles and enemies such as penguins and bees, as well as more traditional Gradius enemies such as moai. As with Gradius, the game utilizes a similar selection-bar based power-up system.</desc>

        <desc>Pastfinder is a vertically scrolling action game which takes place in the year 8878. You are a member of an elite team of explorers known as the Pastfinders. Your goal is to search deadly, radiated planets for various artifacts and time capsules and to deliver them safely to a base. 

At the beginning of each level, you will be presented with the map screen and can select which sector you would like to explore next. At first, only a small portion of the map will be visible but as you make your way through the game additional portions become visible. The amount of radiation in each sector may vary, and the map is color coded to indicate just how deadly a particular sector may be. Next you will have an opportunity to equip your ship with supplies; these include heavy metal (slows the rate at which your ship absorbs radiation), beam shields (protects from enemy fire), scramblers (prevent enemies from tracking you), and a deradiator (decreases accumulated radiation). Equipped items will last until your ship crashes or is destroyed, and additional items can be found on the planet surfaces.

Finally you will be able to explore the planets surface in the sector you have selected! Controlling your ship, you need to avoid walls, enemy craft and other obstacles on the surface while searching for artifacts. Your ship has the ability to jump over obstacles as well as fire lasers to destroy enemies. Each section of the planet is fill with deadly radiation; the longer you're there, the more radiation your ship absorbs. A gauge at the bottom of the screen indicates your ships radiation level, and if it gets too high the ship is destroyed. From time to time floating crystals will appear; shooting these will reduce your ships radiation level a bit. When you finally reach the end of the sector, you will be returned to the map screen where you can choose another sector and begin exploring again.

The game ends when you have lost all of your ships; additional ships can occasionally be found on the planet's surface and are also earned every 5000 points. </desc>

        <desc>In this game, an evil demon called Satan has spread chaos in the world, and someone has to stop him. This is where you come in. 
Playing as the hero Perseus, you have to go to 5 different worlds, each with its own theme, and kill Satan's guardians (end of level bosses). 
A friendly wizard has also given you a magical flying horse called Pegasus, to help you in your quest.

Each world has 10 levels, and half of them are played flying on Pegasus back, and the other half walking, without your magical horse. When flying, the game plays like a Shoot'em up, but when walking, it's a platform game, and you have to rely on your sword.

You can buy weapon upgrades and other bonuses, if you collect enough diamonds. They can be found spread out all over the levels, and fallen enemies drop them sometimes as well. If your health drops too low, you can also heal yourself by spending some diamonds.

After every world, you get a password, letting you continue from the same place the next time you play. That's fortunate, because this game takes a long time to complete.

        <desc>Outland is a 2D platformer that combines mechanics from different games and genres, with fast and agile movement, a large variety of fighting tactics, a fairly open world where newly-acquired abilities urge the player to return to earlier areas and explore new paths, and colour-based gameplay that draws inspiration from bullet hell shooters. The game is set in a mystical world where a man needs to find the balance between two contradictory forces, which is also reflected in the gameplay.

The game is divided in five large worlds that are opened up gradually. At the start of the game the player's character is limited to basic movement: (wall) jumping, crouching, hanging on to ledges and a straightforward sword attack that can be turned into a combo. The focus is largely on taking out enemies to progress through the environment, usually through typical platformer elements such as ladders, ledges, climbing against walls, manipulating levers and switches, and crossing moving platforms. The environment is however immediately filled with paths that cannot be explored. They require abilities to break through stone floors, charge attacks to break through walls, activate jump pads, locate keys, or use teleporters. These are earned after fighting bosses and locating shrines. Once acquired, it is possible to return and explore further. The entire game is however fairly linear as abilities are usually granted at the time they are needed to progress. Another important puzzle mechanic involves bombs left behind by enemies that can be swung around to blow up opponents or break through walls. The character also gradually learns new moves such as slides, air attacks, an upwards slash, a powerful attack based on a limited amount of energy, spikes, and the ability to launch a massive laser beam. Attacks can be linked to form combos and launch opponents into the air to make them dizzy.

The most important game mechanic is a polarity system of two colours, blue (light) and red (dark), similar to games such as Ikaruga. After acquiring both powers, pressing a button changes the character to blue or red. This change of colour has different effects and often requires quick reflexes. Enemies can only be defeated when changing into the opposite colour or attacks do no damage. At the same time the environment is filled with lasers, balls and cannons that have the same two colours. For the environment the player needs to switch to the corresponding colour to absorb the beams and bullets, which becomes difficult when you need to take the enemies into account and different types of projectiles cross paths in large waves. In many sections and especially during the boss battles, the screen is filled with a large amount of objects that force the player to constantly switch colour while attacking. Changing colour can also affect the environment, raising or lowering spikes, or hiding and revealing platforms.

Progress can be tracked through a level map that shows the goals and all important items. While playing, a gush of wind carrying gold leaves shows the general direction at any time. The game is saved at checkpoints. Once the teleporter ability has been learned, it is possible to return to almost any environment in each of the worlds. While playing, the character gathers gold that is exchanged at statues to earn more health or energy, and green hearts restore general health. Many of the optional paths lead to secret areas that contain gold, health or hidden masks for the player to collect. These unlock bonuses such as concept art, but are otherwise optional.

The game contains an online cooperative game mode, arcade levels, and separate cooperative challenges unlocked through the singleplayer mode.</desc>

        <desc>The mission in Vampire is rather obscure. The player must destroy the evil Count Dracula who is devastating the region. The nightmare scenario will be the castle of this malevolent personage. Throughout 95 horrifying rooms the player will be besieged by Dracula's slaves; try to avoid them and obtain the greater amount of food as possible. If the player reunites the five keys and introduce them in its five corresponding bolts, the player will have done a very important part of the mission. In order to obtain each key, the player must find a certain object and fix it in the generator by pedals. If the player does it, the player will be able to jump the enormous pit.

The second part of the mission consists in opening the six magical counter-windows pressing the suitable switches. Finally, search for the hammer and the stake and walk quickly to the superior part of the castle to take the cross. At this moment the player will be teleported to the space to get rid of the final confrontation in which the player will be able to use the laser weapon and the self-propelled knapsack.</desc>

        <desc>Pico Pico is primarily an action game set on a single screen which shows a top-down view of you and your "house". This is a loose collection of bricks that can be shifted by pushing them or firing into them. Suck spiders start invading from the edge of your property, and you must shoot them before they shoot you. The spider's dead bodies can provide extra material for your house. After the first wave of 30 spiders has been killed, your bride arrives, and you receive bonus points for the size of your house. The next wave of spiders then arrives, but now you must also protect your wife. This can be done by surrounding her with bricks, dead spiders, and "stoppers" which you can drop in an empty space in front of you. If you or your wife get shot, you lose a life. After every 30 spiders killed, you receive a bonus, as well as a small amount of time to prepare for the next wave.</desc>

Pippols is a vertically scrolling shooter in which you take control of a lad who navigates what seems to be a garden and shoots hearts at enemies. The screen is divided into five vertical paths by rows of flowers (or other shrubbery and obstacles in later stages). Within the path the protagonist can move freely up and down, but to change the path he needs to jump left or right if there is an opening. You can collect coins and various power-ups as you go. At the end of a stage you can choose one of the branching paths to advance to a different stage.

With a little luck you'll be able to find money bags, silver bars, gold bars, and diamond rings. But many obstacles will get in the way, some of which merely deduct points from your score, while others are fatal. Rolling logs and falling down a hole will deduct points, and scorpions, alligators, snakes, bottomless pits, swamps, and fires will cause Pitfall Harry to lose a life. You have 20 minutes to try to collect all of the treasures on the numerous screens, if you can live that long!</desc>

        <desc>Somewhere lies a beautiful island, which for centuries has been the battle ground for the titanic war between the forces of Light and Darkness. No side was able to control the island for a long time; after a while, the war raged anew, and the island fell under the control of the other side.

Forty years ago, the Light, represented by human being, prevailed in the latest battle. The island was occupied by humans. One day, a strange-looking man appeared on it. He had no memory of his own past, except his name, Dulldeek, and the hatred to humans. Without knowing what this hatred was caused by, Dulldeek feels the rage of the Dark inside him. He decides to infiltrate the castle of Veevik, the humans' fortress, to satisfy his burning anger...

D'ark is a very simple solo first-person dungeon crawler. As Dulldeek, the player navigates maze-like pseudo-3D dungeons (with auto-mapping), encountering randomly appearing enemies and fighting them in turn-based combat to gain experience points and level up. The magic system is very basic, the sole choice being "attack spell" or "healing spell",  both of which consume magic points. A somewhat unusual feature is the option to turn off random encounters completely at any time.</desc>

Conserving the same gaming style and argument of his predecessor, now, you will find a lot of enemies: flies, spiders, flying dragons..., etc etc; the dragon only can be avoided, but the flies can be eaten and as a result, your time to abandon the cave will be increased. The caves are filled of randomly placed rocks and you can jump to left, right or up to jump on them and manage to find the exit.</desc>

        <name>Pooyan (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>In Pooyan, you play the role of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.  

The first screen takes place near the pigs' home.  Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground.  If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.

The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.  If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)

The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.</desc>

He goes to the Purgatory, where he learns that he must find three items to be able to reincarnate: a "concentrated miracles" pill, a videotape with his future recorded and a reincarnation certificate.

Post Mortem is a Spanish adventure game with an icon-based interface similar to the one in Cobra's Arc.</desc>

The true reason for his visit was to satisfy his curiosity, after he had heard so much about the Princess and her extraordinary beauty. Upon laying eyes on her, the Evil King immediately desired her, and using his dark magical powers, he kidnapped her and took her back to his kingdom.

A young and courageous lad known to all as the Knight, had been a close friend of the Princess since early childhood, and was seen as the most likely to marry her and the logical choice as the next heir to the throne. But the Princess, the woman he loved, was now in jeopardy. The Knight wasted no time in volunteering to go to the Evil King's kingdom and rescue his beloved.</desc>

        <name>Puzzle Panic (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>Puzzle Panic is a 1984 puzzle game created by Ken Uston in collaboration with designers Ron Karr, Bob Polin, and Paul Wernick. Ken Uston was better known as a blackjack player and strategist, but he was also a video game author and the creator of Puzzle Panic. The game was originally released on the Commodore 64 and Atari 400/800 in 1984, but later received an MSX port in 1986 by SystemSoft.

Puzzle Panic is more of a minigame compilation than a defined puzzle game. There are eleven different "levels" that can be played, each of which is somehow a pattern based short puzzle game. These range from collecting certain items in a specific order, to reaching a set point under certain conditions.

The player begins the game in a room filled with question marks. There are two doors available, and walking into each one teleports the player to a new game (while the other brings the player to a new room, with two different doors; essentially a hub world). Within these games, there are several modes of difficulty to play through (accessed through three different doors within each game) before moving onto a different screen. All of the games can be accessed at anytime by bringing up the menu (by pressing F2).

When the games are played in order rather than by the menu selection, they are (in reality) part of a larger puzzle, where each puzzle is actually represented by its own symbol, and interaction with the gates at the end of each is integral. In fact, the final puzzle requires the player to select the symbol that represents each level, as well as the order they were played in sequence. The final puzzle was known as "Metasequence," Ken Uston's "ultimate challenge." This larger puzzle was originally intended to be part of a real life contest, where players who managed to complete the puzzle in time (by August 31, 1984) won a trip to Atlantic City with Ken Uston.(Giant Bomb)</desc>

        <desc>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.

The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called &amp;quot;The Force&amp;quot;, which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).

The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</desc>

The main goal in each level is to destroy a factory, which requires a steady increasing amount of bombs. Enemy forces include ships, planes, tanks, anti-air guns, and eventually, a large battleship.</desc>

        <desc>Rath-Tha is a vertically-scrolling shoot-'em-up. In the far future the human race built a long tube that absorbed all of the rubbish generated by the planets in the system. T'ufo - a planet notorious for its dirtiness - has sent a rat-shaped ship called Rath-Tha to destroy the tube. The game commands a ship to destroy Rath-Tha. The game consists of four phases. Starting off inside the tube, the player fights off swarms of enemies. The ship can be moved to any part of the screen while shooting. Next, there is an area with megatronic generators. In the third phase the ship leaves the tube and reaches outer space. It needs to avoid torrents of waste that are immune to shots. The chemical substance alters the ship's controls. Finally, the ship reaches Rath-Tha and needs to fight inside to destroy the core. There are bonuses such as metal waste that restores shield, trash bags to regain energy, and radioactive canisters for temporary immunity. The player also carries three CODA codes to destroy barriers inside Rath-Tha.</desc>

        <name>Rise Out from Dungeons (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>Rise Out From Dungeons is a platform game where you must guide an unnamed character through 20 dungeons avoiding traps and red-colored men. The graphics and game mechanics are strikingly similar to Lode Runner, but with a twist.

As in Lode Runner, you must collect several objects all over the level while avoiding red-colored men, there are many stairs and gaps where you fall down if you are not careful. If you fall in the water, you die. You can also destroy blocks by shooting them with your gun. Curiously enough, the &amp;quot;red men&amp;quot; can't be defeated by your gun, and they will follow you everywhere you go, only to respawn if they reach a point where there's no way out. There are some elements which look like ropes but they are in fact just a special kind of platform: you can always walk across them safely, but if you land on them after falling down, you will just fall through them, so they actually work as traps. Other game elements include a hidden key used to open a door which leads to the stair leading out from the dungeon.

The objective in each dungeon is simply to &amp;quot;rise out&amp;quot; from them, and that can be done by climbing a stair which passes through the dungeon ceiling.

        <desc>River Raid is a vertically scrolling action game. You fly a jet up a river in an attempt to destroy bridges which are vital to the enemy. The river is heavily guarded, however, with balloons, ships, choppers, and enemy aircraft trying to stop you. Along the way you will need to fly over fuel stations to refuel your jet and keep flying.

The plane is armed with a cannon with unlimited ammo. It can be used to destroy the enemy vehicles and bridges, but a careless player can accidentally destroy a fuel station. Colliding with the riverbanks or with the enemy aircraft destroys your plane and makes you lose a life. </desc>

        <name>Robocop (Euro)</name>
        <desc>Patrolman Alex Murphy was killed on the streets of Detroit. The major corporation there, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell a new kind of law enforcement officer to the troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...

Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal's face to the proper mugshot and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.

Amiga and Atari ST versions are faithful to the original level design of the Arcade game, but they also add first-person rescue hostage scenarios, and a mini-game where the player needs to match the suspects' faces

It is your job to lock them down, and then get back to where you started the level. There are 100 levels, and two types of levels. One is just locking down, the others you have to put them in a specific location. There are three levels of difficulty to choose from, you just get paid more the harder the level, and you have less time to complete the level.</desc>

        <desc>This game exists in two editions, one for the MSX1 and one for the MSX2 with better graphics.

In Romancia: Dragon Slayer Jr., you are a young warrior whom the king sends on a mission to rescue a lost princess. You must leave the town and enter the dreadful monster-infested catacombs in order to complete your quest.

The game is a departure from Dragon Slayer RPG-oriented gameplay style. It tends more towards medieval-themed platformer action. The hero has hit points, can buy items and weapons, use magic, and stay in inns to recover health. However, instead of receiving experience points and becoming stronger, you simply must attack quicker (by bumping into your opponent on platform levels) and jump higher.</desc>

        <desc>This game consists in directing an explorer through a gigantic map in the search of four coffee coats which are distributed on it. In the territory where the action takes place we can find rivers, fences, trees, rocks and some more things which can suppose an obstacle for accomplishing the mission. All that together with the presence of killer indigenous serpents which will try to finish with us.

The map has 100 screens that we must cross if we want to find the four coats. Nevertheless, it's necessary to consider that at least one of them is always located inside the cave, which we will only be able to open if previously we found the key. There are also many objects distributed on the way that can help us: boats to cross rivers, tips to break rocks, machetes to cut to the vegetation, etc.</desc>

        <desc>This is a shooting game with a twist. You are in control of a small character who has to go through a serious of stages. Each stage consists of one screen only and contains several energy packs hidden behind various obstacles. Your goal is to eat up all the energy packs at a given stage, or (which is sometimes easier, but with dire consequences to the later stages) destroy them. If you manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them. 

The twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously. Preserving the precious energy points and trying to propel yourself exactly to the obstacles which you must destroy on your way to the energy packs is the only way to successfully complete the game.</desc>

The game objective is to lead a radioactive ball through 20 different boards full of dangers each one. On the left part of the screen we will find an indicator of radioactive energy that will be very important throughout the game, because, while the indicator is over half, we will be able to destroy the movable enemies when hitting against them, but if it is below this limit will not only not destroy the enemies, but in addition the firings of these will repel the trajectory of our ball. All the elements of the game have a specific utility and its knowledge is fundamental for trying to complete the route that will lead us to the last board.</desc>

        <desc>It's a lovely day and Sam is waiting in Central Park to meet his girlfriend Sally. He sees her and walks to her. He only has eyes for her and before he realizes it he finds himself in the New York sewer system.

Three Russian submarines have been located in the New York sewer system and they have blocked off the system.
Sam's only way out of the sewer system is to destroy the Russian submarines. Luckily, Sam carries his revolver.
Sam can't go back... once he's gone through the City Sewer Department seals the tunnel. Luckily, Sam carries his revolver.

The sewer system has three types of sewer tunnels. Tunnels with solid dry floors, tunnels with a water passage in the middle and tunnels with pits. 
Sam can walk, run and creep through the tunnels but Sam can't move as quickly in water.
Sam can move from tunnel to tunnel by entering one of the passages that appear occasionally on his way.
Each time he enters a new sewer, Sam receives a fresh supply of oxygen.

On it's way through the sewer system Sam is under attack by nasties like rats, bats, spiders and more.
The ultimate nasties are the Russian submarines. They are located only in water canals. The status bar at the top of the screen contains a distance indicator. It tells you how far Sam has traveled into the sewer. If it's red, it means there's a dreaded submarine at the end of the sewer.
The more nasty elements you shoot, the higher you'll score.</desc>

        <desc>Once again, alien forces threaten the Earth. Now it's time for you to repel the attack and save the planet.

You control two spaceships simultaneously, which can switch between two different attacking formations: horizontal and vertical.

Along your way, you will find some containers which drop a fusion capsule after being destroyed. Collect 3 capsules with each of your spaceships and they will fuse together, getting an unique spaceship with a greater attacking power. The fusion state will last for some time (check the fusion indicator) or until the fused spaceship gets hit.</desc>

        <name>Sinbad - Nanatsu no Bouken (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>As Sinbad the pirate, you have not been successful recently, and there is mutiny brewing among your crew. The only way to appease them is to find your father?s buried treasure, hidden underground on Corinthia. Trogs and Soldier Ants heavily guard the island, but you have your trusty sword to help. Make sure your food and water levels stay high enough by regularly checking your status.

Viewed from a first-person view, Sinbad must navigate the building in single steps, moving in the current direction or rotating each time. Each of the 54 rooms has a pattern on its door giving some idea of its function. Some are empty, but many contain either objects or hazards (though there is no clue as to whether it is an object or a hazard). Objects include a Compass, a Bag of Gold Coins, a Treasure Chest, and the Magic Lamp, and are automatically collected. The hazards are either a magnet (damaging your compass), Trogs (who are defeated by checking the letter on its shield and pressing the appropriate letter key to jab him with the sword). Soldier Ants are scared into submission (using your torch) in the same way, but they will still lurk menacingly. The third type of room is a Clue Room, which requires the Magic Lamp, and sees you gain a hint from the Wizard.

There are six skill levels ? not only do they increase the number of Trogs and Ants, they also change the letter you must press to defeat them. The position in the alphabet of the killing key is the value of the letter displayed, plus the skill level (so if you see H on level 3, press K, for example.

A small radar at the bottom of the screen shows the enemies' position. Fuel and rockets are limited, but there are several landing platforms where the jet can be refueled and resupplied. Before the jet is able to land however, it needs to be brought to a full halt right above the platform, leaving it vulnerable to attacks. Landing platforms can also be destroyed if they are bombed or enemy planes crash into them. As the game progresses, enemies attack in increasingly large and difficult waves.</desc>

        <name>Slapshot (Euro)</name>
        <desc>Slapshot is an aggressive online street roller-blade hockey game without any principles and rules on the rink. Each game-player logs in and tries to raise his/her level as much as he/she can, playing numerous matches, winning the money, raising their stats, and buying equipment and skills.

There are three kinds of hockey players: Defender, Centre Forward, and Wing Forward. Each of them may be male or female, and they differ by stats. Defender is strong, but slow, while Wing Forward is fast, but not strong. There are 13 stats for each player, which may be raised with level increases and/or with clothes worn or items used.

There are three stages of the game:

1) Tutorial;

2) 1-5 Levels; 

3) 6-50 Levels

During Tutorial stage, you'll learn basic techniques and some tricks available with certain levels.

During 1-5 Levels stage, you may play in 2 kinds of matches:2 human players versus 2 bots
2 human players versus 2 human players

It is a stage to increase your level to 6th, and the ability to earn money if you run out of such on the third stage.

During 6-50 Levels stage, you may play in 3 kinds of matches:1 human player versus 1 human player
2 human players versus 2 human players
3 human players versus 3 human players

It is a stage to increase your level to maximal and become the legend of Slapshot.

Each player may create the room for the rink, adjust its theme, invite others, dismiss unwanted players, protect the room with a password, etc. Winning the money, you as a player may spend it on clothes, which increase your stats, or items such as clubs. Money also may be spent on the skills, which you'll use during gameplay by pressing combination of keys defined for such skill. To master the skill, you may practice in a separate rink.

The hockey gameplay itself is in 3rd person view, while you move your player with arrow keys, and use defined keys to hit the puck, hit the opponent, steal the puck, speed up, use command options, ask a team player for a pass, give a pass  to team player, get ready for a strong hit before a pass, etc. Additional skills allow you to hit the puck sliding left/right, turning in 360 degrees, get out from opponents, hit the puck sliding around the gates, etc. Animation sequences are shown using the game engine, when the match starts, finishes or somebody scores.

During each match some players may have some additional missions (for example to interrupt the pass for 2 times), which gives more money on accomplishment. Tactical and technical actions are calculated for each player during the match and their number and quality influences on experience player gains after the match's end.

Chatting before, after and during the game is possible and allows to understand the desires and mood of each game participant.</desc>

        <desc>You are one of the last four remaining great sorcerers. When Necromancer kidnaps the other three, it is your task to rescue them within a time limit in this action adventure hybrid. 

The player must fly through 17 screens including wastelands, a river and the woods, collecting items and keys to access other screens. Avoid evil ghosts and sorcerers, as they will drain your limited (but replenishable) energy. The final destination is Stonehenge, where the player must kill Necromancer using one of the three potential objects discovered during your journey.</desc>

        <desc>Based on a special effects movie, Space Camp takes place in space (it says so in big letters on the cover). You guide your spaceship through orbit, avoiding meteor showers, military satellites and other obstacles. The control method is much like "lunar lander" type games, but in zero gravity, so a quick thrust with the engines will move the ship indefinitely. Since you have limited oxygen and energy reserves, you must pick up oxygen bottles and energy canisters from the space stations you fly past.

After the vertically scrolling space sequence, you jump out the ship and explore a space station. The control method is the same, and like before, you must keep an eye on oxygen and energy. Apart from said resources, the space stations have hidden treasures hidden below certain panels. Find treasure by gliding across the panels and pushing the joystick button. Certain panels will lead you to hidden treasure chambers. All the while, you must watch out for the space station's guardian, which moves in your direction when you activate your thrusters or press the button. As long as you just glide, the guardian stays put.</desc>

        <name>Space Invaders (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to &amp;quot;the Tank.&amp;quot;  The Tank was based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier.  Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!

Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision (see Battlezone  and Asteroids).  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.

You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</desc>

        <desc>On the surface, Space Trouble looks like an orthodox shooter, but it has an unorthodox twist: Don't shoot! You navigate your ship through an asteroid field, with a finite fuel supply. From time to time, enemy ships come into view and try to hunt you down. Shoot them down, but bear in mind that each shot costs a little bit of fuel. Sometimes, you will encounter a fuel supply, and strewn throughout the game are powerups which boost your &amp;quot;flight record&amp;quot;, which is turned to score as you complete a level. As the game progresses, the asteroids change into other obstacles, such as flying saucers, mines and organic blobs which take several shots to kill. Each enemy ship also has its own movement patterns, some hunting you down, some avoiding your shots, and some just bumbling straight forward. 

When you've passed four different fields, you encounter a mother ship. Docking with the ship requires minute precision, or you will crash and die. The ship teleports you to the next level, which is much like the first.</desc>

For this your able to shoot water at them. The small flames can be quickly extinguished, but new ones keep appearing as long as you do not extinguish the fires they come out of. The larger enemies require several hits. Also pay attention to blocks changing colour to red, that means it is about to combust and an enemy will appear there.</desc>

        <desc>Speed King is a motorbike racing game that allows you to race or practise on one of ten famous tracks like Silverstone, Monza and Daytona. Before you race you can choose the amount of laps (two, four or six) and your skill level (Novice, Champion or Pro). The race has a 3rd person perspective as you watch from behind your rider and try to beat 19 other riders. The joystick is used to control your bike. Besides controlling your speed you also have six gears which need to be changed manually. Once you have finished a race the lap-times are saved and it's time to choose another track.

The C16 version is restricted to four tracks, a set five laps, no skill level and you don't control the speed, just adjust the gears.</desc>

You should jump over various obstacles, avoid ghost-like enemies, climb on ropes, and use inventory items such as dynamite to create obstacle-destroying explosions that will bring you nearer to the desired treasure.</desc>

        <desc>You're in a castle, where a series of magical phenomena have been taking place: a young girl and a military armor have been victims of an enchantment. Its author, an evil warlock and our main enemy, has adopted the form of an eagle and has also requested help of a legion of ghosts, monsters, demons, werewolves and other kinds of despicable creatures, that will try to avoid that we can reach their master.

Once we get started, our immediate goal will consist in the following: In the first place, as every classic magician, we should go in search of our crystal ball. Once we have it, we are going to be able to see which are the movements of all the relevant personages in the story (the young lady, the armor and the eagle), also, it's going to show us where are the resting two elements required for our adventure: the magic wand (with which we will counter-enchant the girl) and the book of spells (essential to break the spell of the armor). 

Here it is where the graphical innovations of the program will occupy the an important place in the game. All these monitorings above mentioned are possible because the screen is divided in two zones. In the superior part we will see the adventures of our personage. Simultaneously, in the inferior zone, there will appear the exact place of the castle in which the object or personage we are looking for is located.</desc>

Años después del lanzamiento del original, Diabolic (el grupo de programación) nos sorprendió con esta secuela de extraordinaria calidad, cuyo único pecado fue, seguramente, haber sido programado fuera de tiempo, en una época en la que el concepto de juego estaba cambiando y donde este tipo de programas apenas despertaba interés entre los usuarios.</desc>

Al quinto desapareceremos como una nube de millones de micropartículas en expansión. Nuestro objetivo es destruir el generador del escudo que protege a la flota del sagrario imperio, lo cual es algo imposible de lograr desde fuera.

Tendremos que pasar sobre seis Supercruceros hasta llegar al navío insignia, donde está el generador. Habrá que tener cuidado con los tambores giratorios de lanzamiento de cazas, con las plataformas aéreas de misiles, con los destructores que se ensamblan en el espacio, con los generadores de barreras de energía, con las cúpulas de mina, con los escuadrones de astrocazas de persecución, y con muchas otras cosas más.</desc>

        <name>Stormbringer (Euro)</name>
        <desc>Stormbringer is the fourth and final game to star Magic Knight, and the only one to make it onto 16-bit systems. Magic Knight must meet with his alter-ego, the Off-White Knight, by reaching his castle hideout - which means clearing 64 screens of adventure.

As with the rest of the series, the game uses a largely visual system, in which a press of the fire button calls up a menu of options, such as 'examine', 'pick up' or 'cast spell. Selecting these calls up a sub-menu to choose what should be examined or thrown, which objects to combine, which spells to cast, and so on. The objects to be used include a chicken, a disguise, and eggs. One new feature is that bolts of lightning are fired down at Magic Knight from the sky, and these must be avoided.</desc>

        <desc>Strange Loop is an arcade action game with 240 different rooms, each filled with dangers. The protagonist, clad in a space suit and armed with a laser gun, has to regain control of a factory located in Outer Space. The factory, where robots are produced, has been taken over by aliens and they are reprogramming the robots to take over planet Earth.

To take over control of the factory, the protagonist has to reach the central Control Room; but to get there he has to overcome many obstacles and collect several objects. These objects can be used to perform several tasks of which some must be done before the player takes over the computer by stopping it. Fuel and patches for the suit can be picked up and retrieve items such as rings and spanners, which are given out by robots or just left around on the floor. The game has an option to save and load the current game status.</desc>

Flash has 7 lives, as all cats have, and he will inevitably loose one by receiving an impact or falling from a building. Luckily, he can recover a lost life by getting a can of fish.

He needs to be really fast if he wants to get to the date on time... so if he hits an obstacle and gets out of the screen, he will have to restart the current stage from the beginning.</desc>

        <desc>You have to search for the 4 artifacts scattered around the bottom of the sea. Once you have everything, carry them to your boat. That's your goal. You have to look after your oxygen reserves. Oxygen diminishes if you touch seaweeds or fancy underwater animals. And just being underwater diminishes it as well, but happily at a much slower pace.

To recover it you whether go to the surface to breathe or find bubbles. Each bubble grants you a "life", this is, 100 extra oxygen units. You start the game with just 100 units and no extra "lives". So you know you have to look for oxygen! You can shoot harpoons which will paralyze your enemies momentarily. They are quite limited. Recovering artifacts give you a few extra harpoons as well. Save them, they can be quite necessary.

Inside the ship you'll find levers which can be activated to make some gates inside the ship to open.</desc>

Instead, it utilizes elements from previous Mario games as well as Super Mario World, from where some enemies and level design ingredients are borrowed.

Unlike those two games, however, Super Boy III  has completely linear levels that must be traversed in a particular order. There are no special levels such as castles, no familiar bonuses, and no power-ups besides those that were introduced in the first Mario game. Mario also walks and runs significantly slower than in Nintendo games. At the end of each stage Mario has to defeat a Hammer Brother.</desc>

        <desc>Super Boy I is a Korean-made unlicensed conversion of Super Mario Bros.. It imports the sprites of Mario and all of the enemies, terrain ingredients, as well as basic gameplay mechanics. The levels resemble those of the original game, most notably the earlier ones; however, only outdoor areas and simplified castles (some without any enemies except Bowser) are included. The game ends after three worlds, each divided into three stages and a castle level.

This version omits much of the material found in Super Mario Bros.. There are no power-ups except the mushroom (which is placed randomly); no warp points; no bonus levels; no cave or underwater areas. Falling platforms replace elevators; pipes cannot be entered. Castles can be completed without defeating the guarding Bowsers. In the castle's final area the player is greeted by the words &amp;quot;Sorry Nothing&amp;quot;. The princess is not mentioned at all.</desc>

        <desc>Super Cobra is a side-scrolling shooter based on the arcade game. You're a chopper pilot on a surveillance mission in enemy territory; your goal is to make it through the various obstacle courses alive and score as many points as possible. Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</desc>

        <desc>Super Columns is an updated version of Columns with more options of play, but with the same setup, maneuvering falling blocks into groups of three or more to eliminate them from the screen.  Along with a Versus mode there is also a Story mode as well.

An evil sorcerer by the name of Surhand has stolen a mystical amulet which brings peace and serenity to the land of Phoenicia and hopes to use it to bring death and destruction to the land.  The player must battle their way through his four guards in a series of best two-out-of-three games of Columns in order to face off against Surhand and bring peace back to the land.

The Flash Mode also returns to this version as well as the new Endless Mode where the main objective is to score as many points as possible before the timer runs out.  There are also special columns throughout these modes such as Glitter Columns which eliminates all blocks of the same color on the screen at once as well as Stone Block Columns which can only be eliminated through magic power-ups that can be obtained by eliminating the base blocks.</desc>

        <desc>Super Golf is an overhead golf game with one complete course of 18 holes. The controls follow the traditional two-click system: the power of the hit and the swerve are determined after pressing a button twice with the correct timing. The used club and the basic direction is set before the hit. Together with the used golfer's talents (putting, power, accuracy and luck) this is used to calculate the result of the hit. There are always four athletes competing; either human or AI controlled.</desc>

La nave es oscura, extraña y poderosa, y dispone de energías capaces de desgarrar la propia textura del espacio. Sus amos son dueños de secretos tecnológicos más allá de toda imaginación, y su palabra es ley para miles de razas en toda la galaxia. Y sin embargo, estos seres tan poderosos ¡tienen un terrible problema...!

El objetivo es perpetuar la raza introduciendo diez vainas en las incubadoras repartidas por toda la nave. El alienígena dispone de una energía que se irá agotando poco a poco. La única forma de reponer energía es soltando las vainas en las incubadores, o bien devorando a los nanoingenieros que hay por la nave. La criatura puede defenderse escupiendo ácido paralizante o escondiéndose en conductos de ventilación, etc.</desc>

It's up to Master Higgins to gather throwing axes, fireballs and skateboards in order to aid his noble quest.

The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to right and finds his power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which results in a great speed enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant death. Another game mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by collecting food on the way. Bosses await him at the end of levels, all the way to the Evil Witch Doctor himself.</desc>

        <desc>In Tank Battalion, you control a tank in a maze. One after another, enemy tanks enter the maze, and you must shoot them all before they reach and destroy your base. The maze walls can be shot and destroyed. After all white tanks are destroyed, you proceed to the next level. Each level layout calls for different tactics, depending on the formations of the walls. Some spots on certain levels make for perfect ambush tactics, on other levels you must rally back and forth to eradicate the enemy tanks. Occasionally a red tank appears, shoot it for bonus points.</desc>

        <desc>The Franciscan monk Noni wants to join the Vitigudina order. To judge his valor, the order asks for a test of virtue: the monk has to collect weapons and use them to exorcise all the demons of a village.

Temptations is a Spanish flick-screen platform game. The game is divided in a series of levels, each with a series of screens. The player controls the monk's movements with the ARROW KEYS or the JOYSTICK. Pressing the SPACE BAR or the FIRE BUTTON shoots the projectile weapon he is carrying. The friar is killed if he touches the demons or some of the screen objects. His movement has inertia: after landing on a platform he usually keeps sliding forward (that is something that must be taken on account when planning how to move from one screen to the other). Shooting choice spots on the screen reveals hidden power-ups that can be collected, and some screens require the use of a specific power-up to reach their exit. The game starts with 10 lives and has no form of saving progress.</desc>

        <desc>This multi-level action/adventure takes players back 40 years to find Professor K.K. Renegade, who predicts that a catastrophic asteroid is heading straight for earth. You're in charge of finding Professor Renegade. 

Select one of the five most intrepid Adventurers from England, France, Germany, Japan, and the U.S. to spearhead the search. Professor Renegade was last seen in the unexplored region of the highest Tibetan ranges; an area populated by creatures and conditions of the professor's own design: venomous stone snakes, reptilian birds, and acid storms. Not only must your Adventurer survive these tests of courage, but he must and properly use such curious objects as spurs, a vacuum cleaner, and a unicycle.
Once you locate the professor and convince him to help, you'll need to help him construct an anti-asteroid deflector to prevent the destruction of earth. You must now search for high-tech tools such as an atomic pile, a 9-volt battery, and a bent coat hanger!

Use the joystick and the appropriate keys to maneuver the Adventurer across the landscape. You have 30 days to complete the mission. During the mission, the Adventurer collects various items (points are awarded for each). Some items serve little purpose; others are vital; and others only work in certain places. Only one item can be held at a time and it must be held to be used. Native bearers carry the items collected. 

To look at what each bearer has, type 1 or 2 to scroll through the bearers. The Adventurer can exchange the item held (press S) with a bearer that is closest to him. Its trial and error time. Good luck. The game comes with cheats and a map for those that require a little help.</desc>

        <desc>Just because a region is bleak, desolate and inhospitable doesn't mean it lacks value. The planet Colian is a case in point; it has plentiful stocks of tough metal Aluma, the explosive Detonite, and the energy giving Quaza crystals. The units which are mining them are under the control of the Empire, and are forced to produce destructive Terrorpod units.

The rival Federation attempts to shut this operation down, and sends you to the surface in a Defence Strategy Vehicle. Your task is to find each of the six bases before the Empire can destroy evidence of them. Destroy all the Terrorpods in order to reach the bases.

The action is viewed from your DSV, as you move and shoot at any encroaching Terrorpods. Colian has a heavy inertia field, so you are always moving. You have guided missiles at your disposal, although these use up some of your limited Detonite stocks. Missiles will also be aimed at you; avoid these.

As all this action unfolds, you are trying to ensure that enough components can be produced in the mines, and can be retrieved in order to go towards the Federation's own building efforts. Collect the resultant products to attach them to your DSV.</desc>

The sequel to Black Onyx is very similar to its predecessor, graphically as well as gameplay-wise. You build a party of up to five adventurers and take them to fight in first-person 3D dungeons. You encounter random enemies as well as fellow adventurers, whom you can recruit to your party if it is not full.</desc>

In order to find this mysterious artifact, they have to venture into a system of dungeons and to defeat the monsters that live in them.

The sequel to Black Onyx is very similar to its predecessor, graphically as well as gameplay-wise. You build a party of up to five adventurers and take them to fight in first-person 3D dungeons. You encounter random enemies as well as fellow adventurers, whom you can recruit to your party if it is not full.</desc>

        <name>The Cure (HB)</name>
        <desc>Winning entry in the MSXdev'05 coding competition, The Cure is an arcade jump&amp;run heavily influenced by Konami's classic Vampire Killer.

The hero, who does look a bit like The Cure's Robert Smith dressed in Mega Man's clothes, starts out in a demonic landscape on his quest to rid the land of the most evil One and his minions. After traversing the cursed landscape, you enter a castle, which will be directly recognisable to anyone who has played Castlevania.

Equipped only with a whip, the hero must choose his battles. However, strewn across the levels are keys which will open chests containing bonuses which will render (short-term) invincibility, lengthen your whip or grant you a subweapon, such as a throwing dagger or an hourglass to freeze time momentarily. Subweapons consume hearts, which can be found not only in chests, but by destroying monsters or whipping down candles from the castle's walls.

The Cure features a soundtrack with several pieces throughout, swap-screen "scrolling" and both hardware and plotted sprites.(Moby Games)</desc>

        <desc>Once upon a time, a demon called Sharudo came to Fairy's land, creating havoc. He built a monster town on a mountain top and dwelled there, ruling over the land below. One day, Sharudo came and took princess Chris to his monster lair. Now it's up to Ares, a brave soldier in the service of the Fairies, to save Chris.

Demon Crystal is an action puzzle game. Scattered around the stage are numerous keys which help open locked areas. The goal is to find the big key which is needed to open the exit and advance to the next stage. Ares' only weapon is a limited number of bombs, which explode in a flame and can kill multiple enemies at once. The game consists of 30 stages (houses).</desc>

On each level you have a quota of enemies that need to be destroyed. After fulfilling your quota, a final boss of the level will appear; when destroyed, you will move on to the next level. The game begins in the year 1910, and each time a level is completed you advance in time. In 1910 you only have to face relatively unarmed biplanes, but as the levels advance so does the technology. Each new level brings with it tougher, more heavily armed aircraft including jets, helicopters, and even flying saucers! From time to time, you will encounter a parachute; if you run into this, you will earn bonus points.</desc>

        <desc>Dark forces have set out to destroy the fabric of time, by opening eight space-time continuum portals. Each one is guarded by a great mind, who must have a relevant object returned to them before they will allow you to seal the portals. Doing this requires formulating a spell from the runes the Minds give you.

All of this is played out in a combination of side-view action and icon-based object manipulation. Starting in your living room as you search for a weapon and its bullets, you move along a network of levels and ladders, avoiding or shooting the many foes you encounter. Pressing down and fire together brings up a menu allowing you to pick up items, swap them with Guardians, and cast spells (with the chance to test them first).</desc>

You rotate your tyre left or right, and drift as the current sends you, making sure to avoid the banks of the river, and the dividing lines in the middle. Hazards include crocodiles, stray logs and branches, and fishermen - you are armed with a limited supply of tin cans to take care of these. There are gates to slide through on the way down - these give you a points bonus. Each level has a strict time limit to adhere to, although there's a kickin' party at the end if you succeed.</desc>

        <desc>Topple Zip is a vertically scrolling shooter that is marketed as a racing game. The basic premise is that you control an aircraft and fly in competition against several other, computer controlled crafts. In addition to shooting at your opponents, you may ram into them, and they into you. Doing so may dislodge a pill shaped power-up from them which you can then shoot and collect. 

Power-ups exist in various types, including defensive and offensive such as giving you better weapons. There are eight different levels, each of which contain a number of warps which link to other levels. How the levels connect is random each time you play the game. 

The goal of the game is to locate a key which is necessary to access the warp which leads to the eight and final level. Collect it from whichever level it is hidden inside of, and access the eighth level before any of your competitors.</desc>

        <desc>Track &amp; Field is a sports game that allows the player to have an experience based around the Summer Olympic Games. Events include the 100 meter dash, the hammer throw, the javelin throw, the long jump, the high jump and the 110 meter hurdles.

The MSX version replaces the hurdles with a 400 meter dash.

The Famicom version loses the hammer throw and the high jump, but the NES version restores the high jump while adding skeet shooting, the triple jump and archery as events. The NES version also keeps the 110 meter hurdles and forgoes the 400 meter dash.

If the player wants to go to the next event or round then they will have to qualify, by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum distances. This game contains a two player option, in which the players take it in turns.</desc>

An opportunist civilization has stolen all the charged spheres from your home planet, preparing for a future invasion. As a last chance, the last remaining sources of energy have been transfered to a scout ship and sent to recover the spheres... this is your last chance of survival!

In each level of Transball, the goal is to find the energy sphere, capture it and carry it to the upper part of the level. The main obstacle is the gravity, that pulls you towards the ground. But many other obstacles such as canons, tanks, doors, etc. will make your journey harder than it seems.</desc>

You must travel in your turboat along a river infested with enemy patrol boats which shoot at you. Unlike the above-mentioned games, you can turn your boat with a fair amount of precision. This is absolutely necessary in order to avoid the enemy shots which come not only from ships, but from turrets on the shore as well. You must also avoid contact with ground, such as the small islands which float in the river. Luckily, you can shoot back at the enemy, but don't forget to look where you're going!</desc>

        <name>Turmoil (Jpn)</name>
        <desc>Turmoil is a fast-paced shooter. You pilot a ship that is trapped within a chamber of seven tunnels.  Your ship can only move up and down along a vertical corridor connecting the tunnels.  You are not alone, however.  A variety of enemies travel along these tunnels, focused on destroying you.  Therefore, the ultimate objective of ?Turmoil? is to zoom up and down the center alley and blast aliens as they streak by.  Keep shooting and keep moving, and you will survive to live another day!  As you move quickly up and down, you must also fire your own weapons into to the left or right side.  Part of the intensity of this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too long.  If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move onward once more.

The enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a variety of unique speeds.  The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you will receive if you shoot them.  Occasionally when you destroy one of the enemy ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel.  This is the one exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway.  In these situations you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it.  If you grab it quickly, it is worth bonus points.  If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast moving missile and will destroy you if you get in its way.
 
When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships.  If you can blast all of the aliens in a level, you'll receive a bonus ship.  In addition to your current ship, you can hold as many as six reserve ships at one time.  You will loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens.  There are nine levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster and more challenging then the previous level.  This is considered by many to be one of 20th Century Fox's best games.</desc>

        <desc>TwinBee is a vertical scrolling shooter. The players control cartoon-like spacecrafts with anthropomorphic arms, player one being TwinBee and player two being WinBee. The spacecrafts can be moved in all 8 directions, with one button for regular shooting flying enemies and one button for dropping ground bombs.

Power-ups in the form of bells can be collected by shooting clouds. The color of the bell will change if it is shot by the player, assuming one of the possible colors:

    Yellow: grants bonus points;
    White: upgrades player's guns to a twin cannon;
    Blue: increases player's speed (up to five levels);
    Green: creates image copies of the craft for more firepower;
    Red: provides a shield to sustain damage.

The green and red bells cannot be combined. Alternate power ups can be collected from the ground, such as an alternate bell which upgrades the craft with a three way gun and a star which destroys all enemies on screen.

One shot in the middle section of the craft will destroy it. Shots which hit one of the craft's arms will destroy only the arm. If both arms are lost, the craft won't be able to shoot bombs anymore and will have to be repaired by an ambulance.

In the two-player mode, TwinBee (cyan craft) and WinBee (red craft) have the same speed and they can join "hand-to-hand" and fire a super blast. Also in two player mode, if one craft is hit by the other from behind, it will fire four multi-directional shots.</desc>

        <desc>In the future, Earth must protect itself from alien invaders, a task handled by the Science Special Search Party. However, they are not alone in this endeavor. After crashing his ship on Earth while in pursuit of the evil alien Bemular, the super-being Ultraman is here to help whenever the attacking aliens prove too much for humanity alone to handle. Standing hundreds of feet tall with incredible strength and amazing abilities, he can only remain on Earth for a few minutes, and so must defeat his foes before his power drains completely.

Based on the popular television show from 1967, Ultraman directly follows the story of its source material. Cast in the role of the titular Ultraman, the player must defeat many of the same monsters that appeared in the original series. Taking the appearance of a 1-on-1 fighting game, Ultraman can punch, kick, and grapple his opponent, as well as use a variety of various special moves that must be charged. However, in order to actually defeat his opponent, Ultraman must deplete their continually-recharging life bar, and at that moment hit with his most powerful special attack: the Specium Beam. As the game continues, different enemies may even find ways to avoid this most formidable attack, and Ultraman must adapt... Each stage has a time limit of only three minutes, and there are three lives and no continues.</desc>

        <desc>The mission in Vampire is rather obscure. The player must destroy the evil Count Dracula who is devastating the region. The nightmare scenario will be the castle of this malevolent personage. Throughout 95 horrifying rooms the player will be besieged by Dracula's slaves; try to avoid them and obtain the greater amount of food as possible. If the player reunites the five keys and introduce them in its five corresponding bolts, the player will have done a very important part of the mission. In order to obtain each key, the player must find a certain object and fix it in the generator by pedals. If the player does it, the player will be able to jump the enormous pit.

The second part of the mission consists in opening the six magical counter-windows pressing the suitable switches. Finally, search for the hammer and the stake and walk quickly to the superior part of the castle to take the cross. At this moment the player will be teleported to the space to get rid of the final confrontation in which the player will be able to use the laser weapon and the self-propelled knapsack.</desc>

        <desc>In the intergalactic war, the Amstradian empire has taken over most of the known universe. Earth is still putting up some resistance, but is running out of natural resources. It is discovered that the old mining planet of Vestron contains a special kind of crystals which can be substituted for oil. Retrieving these crystals is imperative for Earth to be able to keep on fighting, so you are sent alone to recover the energy source from Vestron.

The game is made up of two different screens. On the static screen, you fly around in your space suit right above the surface, where crystals can be found. Pick up the crystals while avoiding the Amstradians, which luckily move back and forth in preset patterns. If you run the risk of a collision, you can press the space bar to activate your Asteroids style emergency teleport. This feature should be used only as a last-ditch effort, since you could just as well teleport straight into another enemy. You can travel up, left and right, to travel down you just let gravity do its job.

After having retrieved the crystals on the static screen, you progress to a scrolling screen which takes you to the next crystal site. In order to get through this screen, you must avoid all the Amstradian ships which attack in a kamikaze fashion. Reflexes are a requirement, since the enemies move very quickly and track all your movements.</desc>

        <desc>Vigilante is a side-scrolling beat-em-up. It features an anonymous tough hero that roams the streets to beat up The Rogues gang that kidnapped his girlfriend Maria. The game offers five distinct locations, such as city streets and a junkyard, with many different thugs with different strengths. You fight with your fists, feet and a chain, with a regular stance, crouched and jumping attacks. Each level features an end boss which requires a specific tactic in order to progress. Enemies keep spawning continuously from the left and the right side of the screen until the boss is reached, so a steady pace forward is required to reach the end of the level before time runs out. When enemies come too close they will grab the character and quick presses left and right are need to set him free, as he is then vulnerable to incoming attacks.</desc>

        <desc>Volguard is a traditional shoot-'em-up. You fly a plane over a parallax-scrolling landscape, filled with enemy installations which you must bomb. An easy task, if it weren't for the enemy attack waves. Most waves consist of planes flying in a straight line across the screen, without even shooting at you. Others bounce across the screen, and some are more dangerous, as they are flying in intricate patterns and firing multiple shot. Of course, you can fire back, but keep that at a minimum. The power bar at the bottom of the screen is depleted by your cannon, and when it has reached zero, your firing rate is very low. After a while, a route comrade will join you as a kind of power-up. When a third plane joins, you may merge your fighters into a flying robot.</desc>

        <desc>Warroid is a game that pits two players (or one player and the AI) against each other in a robot versus robot fight. The objective: shoot the enemy warroid until it has no energy left. Destroying the enemy warroid will give the player one point on the six-point scale (the player starts out with three points each). When all points are lit in the player's color, the player wins the game. Controlling the warroid is easy, since it will always point its gun towards the enemy droids. Just push the space key to shoot a lot and jump away from the line of fire. There are multiple platform-like levels for the player to fight in.

A menu (called up by pressing the escape key) will let the player customize the game so as to set handicap and the colours of the player's warroids.</desc>

        <desc>Eight invaded townships must be brought back under your control in this Commando-style shoot 'em up, which progresses vertically using a flick-screen system. You are armed with a rifle (activated by a short tap of the fire button) and five grenades (used via a longer press), and must not only kill off the enemy forces, but also rescue your comrades who have been tied to trees along the way. You begin at the bottom of the first screen and slowly make your way upwards; enemies pop up from all sides, walking around and shooting, and you have to dodge their shots while trying to shoot them yourself. The foes make good use of the decoy opportunities of the terrain, and you must do the same to have a chance. The levels include rivers with narrow bridges, potholes, and train-lines.

Extra supplies are dropped in as you progress through the game, as are extra lives in addition to your starting 5. </desc>

It's up to Master Higgins to gather throwing axes, fireballs and skateboards in order to aid his noble quest.

The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to right and finds his power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which results in a great speed enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant death. Another game mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by collecting food on the way. Bosses await him at the end of levels, all the way to the Evil Witch Doctor himself.</desc>

The enemies' goal is to destroy the energy centers of the city, and the brave pilot must stop them at all costs. The gameplay is similar to that of Falcon Patrol: player-controlled jet moves in four directions, destroying enemies with missiles, and needs to recharge fuel and ammunition at specific points, where it becomes particularly vulnerable to enemy attacks.</desc>

The game, however, is set in a fantasy world, its Xanadu being mysterious ruins beneath a prosperous kingdom, where only the bravest adventurers dare to venture. The player takes the role of one of such explorers, who is sent by the king to discover the secrets hidden deep within the ruins.

Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II bears many similarities to the first Dragon Slayer, being a dungeon-crawling role-playing game with action combat, primarily revolving around exploration of vast underground mazes. Unlike the previous game, the exploration in Xanadu is conducted from a side-scrolling perspective. There are no platforming elements in the game, and action-based gameplay is confined to combat only. Like in its predecessor, attacking enemies involves simply "bumping" into them, gaining advantage by positioning the hero so that he faces the enemy.

Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies. There are two types of experience: fighter and magician, gained from attacking physically and casting spells, respectively. Weapons and armor also gain experience and level up, depending on the amount of time the protagonist equips them for. The main character must visit a temple in order to increase his level.

Money can be found in the dungeon or dropped by enemies, and later spent to purchase equipment and items in shops. The player must also regularly feed the hero, as he will get weak and eventually die without food. The game features a "karma" system, which keeps track of the alignment of the enemies killed by the protagonist. If he kills too many "good" enemies, temples might refuse to level him up.</desc>

        <desc>Zanac (ã‚¶ãƒŠãƒƒã‚¯) is an arcade-style shoot 'em up video game designed by Compile and published in Japan by Pony Canyon and in North America by FCI. It was released for the MSX computer, the Family Computer Disk System, the Nintendo Entertainment System, and for the Virtual Console. It was reworked for the MSX2 computer as Zanac EX and for the PlayStation as Zanac X Zanac. Players fly a lone starfighter, dubbed the AFX-6502 Zanac, through twelve levels; their goal is to destroy the Systemâ€”a part-organic, part-mechanical entity bent on destroying Mankind.</desc>

        <desc>The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in this isometric-viewed shoot 'em up. The game has three stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.

Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are three distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.</desc>

        <desc>Zenji is an action/strategy game where you control a rolling face throughout a maze. Each section of the maze can be rotated by the face. The goal is to turn the entire maze green by connecting each section of the maze to the source at the center of the screen. After all sections of the maze have been connected, you can move on to the next, more challenging level. In addition to having a time limit to complete your task, you need to avoid the flames and sparks which wander about the maze. From time to time a number will appear in a maze section and count down from 9 to 0. If you touch the number before it disappears, bonus points are earned. As the levels progress, the mazes become larger, trickier and more flames will appear.</desc>

        <desc>Zoom 909 (ã‚ºãƒ¼ãƒ 909) is an arcade game developed by Sega for VCO Object arcade hardware. It was released worldwide in 1982, however, after obtaining a license for Buck Rogers, western versions of the game became known as Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom. Both Zoom 909 and Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom are largely the same game minus some minor graphical differences.

Though most home ports of the game are based on Planet of Zoom, Zoom 909 was brought to the Japanese MSX in 1983 and SG-1000 in 1985. These versions take more liberties with the formula, introducing a top-down stage as level 3.</desc>
